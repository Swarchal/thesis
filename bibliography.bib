abstract = {Deep neural networks are representation learning techniques. During training, a deep net is capable of generating a descriptive language of unprecedented size and detail in machine learning. Extracting the descriptive language coded within a trained CNN model (in the case of image data), and reusing it for other purposes is a field of interest, as it provides access to the visual descriptors previously learnt by the CNN after processing millions of images, without requiring an expensive training phase. Contributions to this field (commonly known as feature representation transfer or transfer learning) have been purely empirical so far, extracting all CNN features from a single layer close to the output and testing their performance by feeding them to a classifier. This approach has provided consistent results, although its relevance is limited to classification tasks. In a completely different approach, in this paper we statistically measure the discriminative power of every single feature found within a deep CNN, when used for characterizing every class of 11 datasets. We seek to provide new insights into the behavior of CNN features, particularly the ones from convolutional layers, as this can be relevant for their application to knowledge representation and reasoning. Our results confirm that low and middle level features may behave differently to high level features, but only under certain conditions. We find that all CNN features can be used for knowledge representation purposes both by their presence or by their absence, doubling the information a single CNN feature may provide. We also study how much noise these features may include, and propose a thresholding approach to discard most of it. All these insights have a direct application to the generation of CNN embedding spaces.},

Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81{\%} of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io.

This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the $\backslash$overfeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the $\backslash$overfeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the $\backslash$overfeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or {\$}L2{\$} distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks.},

@article{Yosinski2014,
abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

Clinically applicable regimens for overcoming trastuzumab resistance of different mechanisms are not yet available. We show that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (SRC) is a key modulator of trastuzumab response and a common node downstream of multiple trastuzumab resistance pathways. We find that SRC is activated in both acquired and de novo trastuzumab-resistant cells and uncover a novel mechanism of SRC regulation involving dephosphorylation by PTEN. Increased SRC activation conferred considerable trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells and correlated with trastuzumab resistance in patients. Targeting SRC in combination with trastuzumab sensitized multiple lines of trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab and eliminated trastuzumab-resistant tumors in vivo, suggesting the potential clinical application of this strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.},

abstract = {The interactions of multiple myeloma (MM) cells with their microenvironment are crucial for pathogenesis. MM cells could interact differentially with their microenvironment depending on the type of cyclin D they express. We established several clones that constitutively express cyclin D1 from the parental RPMI8226 MM cell line and analyzed the impact of cyclin D1 expression on cell behavior. We performed a gene expression profiling study on cyclin D1-expressing vs. control cells and validated the results by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of cyclin D1 altered the transcription of genes that control adhesion and migration. We confirmed that cyclin D1 increases cell adhesion to stromal cells and fibronectin, stabilizes F-actin fibers, and enhances chemotaxis and inflammatory chemokine secretion. Both control and cyclin D1-expressing cells were more resistant to acute carfilzomib treatment when cultured on stromal cells than in suspension. However, this resistance was specifically reduced in cyclin D1-expressing cells after pomalidomide pre-treatment that modifies tumor cell/microenvironment interactions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that cyclin D1 expression was also associated with changes in the expression of genes controlling metabolism. We also found that cyclin D1 expression disrupted the redox balance by producing reactive oxygen species. The resulting oxidative stress activated the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (or ERK1/2) signaling pathway, increased cell adhesion to fibronectin or stromal cells, and controlled drug sensitivity. Our results have uncovered a new function for cyclin D1 in the control of redox metabolism and interactions of cyclin D1-expressing MM cells with their bone marrow microenvironment.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Elevated cyclin D1 in human pancreatic cancer correlates with poor prognosis. Because pancreatic cancer is invariably resistant to chemotherapy, the goal of this study was to examine whether the drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells is in part attributed to cyclin D1 overexpression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Stable overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA)--mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 were done in the newly established Ela-myc pancreatic tumor cell line. Cisplatin sensitivity of control, overexpressing, and siRNA-transfected cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, clonogenic, and apoptotic assays [DNA fragmentation, sub-G1, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage analysis]. The role of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptotic proteins in cyclin D1-mediated chemoresistance was examined by EMSA and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Overexpression of cyclin D1 in Ela-myc pancreatic tumor cells promoted cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, cyclin D1-overexpressing cells exhibited significantly reduced chemosensitivity and a higher survival rate upon cisplatin treatment, as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and clonogenic assays, respectively. Although overexpression of cyclin D1 rendered cells more resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, siRNA-directed suppression of cyclin D1 expression resulted in enhanced susceptibility to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. The attenuation of cisplatin-induced cell death in cyclin D1-overexpressing cells was correlated with the up-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB activity and maintenance of bcl-2 and bcl-xl protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that overexpression of cyclin D1 can contribute to chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells because of the dual roles of cyclin D1 in promoting cell proliferation and in inhibiting drug-induced apoptosis.},

Repression of E-cadherin also stimulated cell proliferation and migration in vitro, decreased cell amount essential for xenografts formation in nude mice, increased tumors vascularization and growth.

abstract = {ATP binding cassette (ABC)-containing drug efflux transporters play important roles in regulating intracellular drug concentrations that determine cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Of particular relevance to cancer chemotherapy are the transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by multidrug resistance 1 gene, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). More than 80{\%} of currently used antitumor agents can be transported by these three transporters, and overexpression of these transporters renders multidrug resistance to a broad spectrum of antitumor agents. Elevated expression of these transporters is frequently found in breast cancers and correlations with elevated expression of Pgp or MRP1 to chemotherapeutic outcomes have been observed in some cases, suggesting that these transporters may contribute to chemoresistance in breast cancers. However, attempts to modulate the activities of these transporters using reversal agents have met with limited success. Future studies should focus on better understanding of the upregulation mechanisms ofABC transporter genes in breast cancers, and of the pharmacologic mechanisms of transporter-reversal agent interactions. These studies may lead to novel strategies for improving chemotherapeutic efficacies through targeted interventions of these ABC transporters.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) is an in vitro model associating malignant-cell microenvironment and 3D organization as currently observed in avascular tumors. METHODS: In order to evaluate the relevance of this model for pre-clinical studies of drug combinations, we analyzed the effect of gemcitabine alone and in combination with the CHIR-124 CHK1 inhibitor in a Capan-2 pancreatic cell MCTS model. RESULTS: Compared to monolayer cultures, Capan-2 MCTS exhibited resistance to gemcitabine cytotoxic effect. This resistance was amplified in EGF-deprived quiescent spheroid suggesting that quiescent cells are playing a role in gemcitabine multicellular resistance. After a prolonged incubation with gemcitabine, DNA damages and massive apoptosis were observed throughout the spheroid while cell cycle arrest was restricted to the outer cell layer, indicating that gemcitabine-induced apoptosis is directly correlated to DNA damages. The combination of gemcitabine and CHIR-124 in this MCTS model, enhanced the sensitivity to the gemcitabine antiproliferative effect in correlation with an increase in DNA damage and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that our pancreatic MCTS model, suitable for both screening and imaging analysis, is a valuable advanced tool for evaluating the spatio-temporal effect of drugs and drug combinations in a chemoresistant and microenvironment-depending tumor model.},

abstract = {Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are used as organotypic models of normal and solid tumor tissue. Traditional techniques for generating MCTS, such as growth on nonadherent surfaces, in suspension, or on scaffolds, have a number of drawbacks, including the need for manual selection to achieve a homogeneous population and the use of nonphysiological matrix compounds. In this study we describe a mild method for the generation of MCTS, in which individual spheroids form in hanging drops suspended from a microtiter plate. The method has been successfully applied to a broad range of cell lines and shows nearly 100{\%} efficiency (i.e., one spheroid per drop). Using the hepatoma cell line, HepG2, the hanging drop method generated well-rounded MCTS with a narrow size distribution (coefficient of variation [CV] 10{\%} to 15{\%}, compared with 40{\%} to 60{\%} for growth on nonadherent surfaces). Structural analysis of HepG2 and a mammary gland adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7, composed spheroids, revealed highly organized, three-dimensional, tissue-like structures with an extensive extracellular matrix. The hanging drop method represents an attractive alternative for MCTS production, because it is mild, can be applied to a wide variety of cell lines, and can produce spheroids of a homogeneous size without the need for sieving or manual selection. The method has applications for basic studies of physiology and metabolism, tumor biology, toxicology, cellular organization, and the development of bioartificial tissue.},

Invasion of GBM cells into normal brain is the major cause of poor prognosis and requires dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which includes lamellipodial protrusions, focal adhesions, and stress fibers at the leading edge of GBM. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibitors of actin polymerization can suppress GBM migration and invasion. First, we adopted a drug repositioning system for screening with a pyrene-actin-based actin polymerization assay and identified fluvoxamine, a clinically used antidepressant. Fluvoxamine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization and confirmed as drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulation of whole brain including brain tumor with no drug toxicity. Fluvoxamine inhibited serum-induced ruffle formation, cell migration, and invasion of human GBM and glioma stem cells in vitro by suppressing both FAK and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Daily treatment of athymic mice bearing human glioma-initiating cells with fluvoxamine blocked tumor cell invasion and prolonged the survival with almost same dose of anti-depressant effect. In conclusion, fluvoxamine is a promising anti-invasive treatment against GBM with reliable approach.},

As autophagy activation is involved in promoting adipogenic differentiation, we examined whether anti-autophagic AQ affected adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. AQ dose-dependently and significantly suppressed adipocyte differentiation in conjunction with decreases in lipid droplet formation and expression of adipogenic markers including adiponectin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2), resistin, and leptin. Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) decreases by inhibition of autophagy, AQ treatment did not induce PPARgamma degradation despite the suppression of autophagolysosomal degradation. Instead, AQ suppressed the PPARgamma activity to transcriptionally activate the aP2 gene transcription through the selective prevention of nuclear localization of PPARgamma. These results demonstrated the novel anti-adipogenic activity of AQ and identified its underlying mechanism that AQ suppressed adipogenic gene expression and lipid formation by inhibiting nuclear localization of PPARgamma in an autophagy-independent manner. AQ is recommended as a safe and effective anti-obesity drug for controlling overweight and obesity.},

Dilazep, a nucleoside transport inhibitor, is used to treat ischemic dysfunction. However, little is known about the effect of dilazep in inducing HIV expression in latently infected cells. Using the Jurkat T cell model of HIV-1 latency, we found that dilazep effectively reactivates latent HIV-1 gene expression in a dose manner. We observed that dilazep synergistically reactivated latent HIV-1 transcription with valproic acid. We also found that dilazep activates viral latency without inducing cell surface activation markers CD25 and CD69 activation. In summary, dilazep, alone or in combination with VPA, could be useful in future eradication strategies.},

The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated on A549, MCF-7, HepG2 and L-02 cell lines. As a result, most of the compounds were more potent than the positive drugs Etoposide (VP-16) and Doxorubicin which were widely used in clinical for antitumor. There were no magnitude differences about these de-protected (without Boc group) podophyllotoxin amino acid derivatives' cytotoxicity between three tumor cell lines and normal hepatic L-02 cells. Interestingly, some protected (with Boc group) amino acid derivatives and some ligustrazine derivatives showed high selectivity, especially the compound 2 (sarcosine derivative with Boc group). It exhibited highly selectivity both on the cancer cells and the normal cells. The IC50of compound 2 was 9.5 ± 0.03 nM, 132.6 ± 24.1 nM, 96.4 ± 1.3 nM and 160.2 ± 4.7 nM against A549, MCF-7, HepG2 and L-02 cells, respectively. The SI (IC50L−02/IC50A549) value of compound 2, Doxorubicin and Etoposide was 16.9, 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. Meanwhile, SI (IC50MCF−7/IC50A549) value and SI (IC50HepG2/IC50A549) value of compound 2 were 14.0 and 10.1, respectively. In summary, compound 2 showed high selectivity especially on A549 cells. Further research on cell apoptosis indicated that compound 2 could induce apoptosis of A549 cells through nuclei fragmentation and had lower toxicity to normal hepatic L-02 cells. The detection of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis indicated that compound 2 induced A549 cells apoptosis and prevented A549 cells transition from S to G2phase while there were no obvious changes on L-02 cells. Moreover, the structure-activity relationships of these derivatives were briefly discussed.},

FluPar treatment protected macaques from SIV-induced neurodegeneration, as measured by neurofilament light chain in the CSF, APP accumulation in the axons, and CaMKII$\alpha$ in the frontal cortex, but did not significantly reduce markers of neuroinflammation or plasma or CNS viral loads.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) have been clinically prescribed in the auxiliary treatment of cancer patients. Although protriptyline, a type of TCA, was used primarily in the clinical treatment of mood disorders in cancer patients, the effect of protriptyline on physiology in human osteosarcoma is unknown. This study examined the effect of protriptyline on cytosolic free Ca2+concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and viability in MG63 human osteosarcoma cells. Protriptyline between 50 and 250 $\mu$M evoked [Ca2+]irises concentration-dependently. Protriptyline induced influx of Mn2+, indirectly implicating Ca2+influx. Protriptyline-evoked Ca2+entry was inhibited by nifedipine by 20{\%} but was not altered by econazole, SKF96365, GF109203X, and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). In Ca2+-free medium, treatment with protriptyline inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+pump inhibitor thapsigargin-evoked [Ca2+]irises. Conversely, treatment with thapsigargin inhibited 45{\%} of protriptyline-evoked [Ca2+]irises. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 failed to alter protriptyline-evoked [Ca2+]irises. Protriptyline at 50–250 $\mu$M decreased cell viability, which was not reversed by pretreatment with the Ca2+chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Collectively, our data suggest that in MG63 cells, protriptyline induced [Ca2+]irises by evoking Ca2+release from the endoplasmic reticulum and other stores in a PLC-independent manner, and Ca2+entry via a nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+pathway. Protriptyline also caused Ca2+-independent cell death.},

The HIV proteins secreted from infected macrophages, gp120 and Tat, are neurotoxic. The goal of this study was to screen, identify and develop neuroprotective compounds relevant to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). We screened more than 2000 compounds that included FDA approved drugs for protective efficacy against oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration and identified selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as potential neuroprotectants. Numerous SSRIs were then extensively evaluated as protectants against neurotoxicity as measured by changes in neuronal cell death, mitochondrial potential, and axodendritic degeneration elicited by HIV Tat and gp120 and other mitochondrial toxins. While many SSRIs demonstrated neuroprotective actions, paroxetine was potently neuroprotective (100 nM potency) against these toxins in vitro and in vivo following systemic administration in a gp120 neurotoxicity model. Interestingly, the inhibition of serotonin reuptake by paroxetine was not required for neuroprotection, since depletion of the serotonin transporter had no effect on its neuroprotective properties. We determined that paroxetine interacts selectively and preferentially with brain mitochondrial proteins and blocks calcium-dependent swelling but had less effect on liver mitochondria. Additionally, paroxetine induced proliferation of neural progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo in gp120 transgenic animals. Therefore, SSRIs such as paroxetine may provide a novel adjunctive neuroprotective and neuroregenerative therapy to treat HIV-infected individuals.},

Initially we filtered out ZINC and Drugbank databases with similarity and QSAR models and then we submitted the candidates to a validated docking based screening.

Ivermectin belongs to the group of avermectins (AVM), a series of 16-membered macrocyclic lactone compounds discovered in 1967, and FDA-approved for human use in 1987. It has been used by millions of people around the world exhibiting a wide margin of clinical safety. In this review, we summarize thein vitroandin vivoevidences demonstrating that ivermectin exerts antitumor effects in different types of cancer. Ivermectin interacts with several targets including the multidrug resistance protein (MDR), the Akt/mTOR and WNT-TCF pathways, the purinergic receptors, PAK-1 protein, certain cancer-related epigenetic deregulators such as SIN3A and SIN3B, RNA helicase, chloride channel receptors and preferentially target cancer stem-cell like population. Importantly, thein vitroandin vivoantitumor activities of ivermectin are achieved at concentrations that can be clinically reachable based on the human pharmacokinetic studies done in healthy and parasited patients. Thus, existing information on ivermectin could allow its rapid move into clinical trials for cancer patients.},

abstract = {Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a novel class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure-activity modeling. ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.},

abstract = {One of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results. {\textcopyright} 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

This is an increasingly utilized strategy for finding novel medicines, one that capitalizes on previous investments while derisking clinical activities. This approach is of interest primarily because we continue to face significant gaps in the drug-target interactions matrix and to accumulate safety and efficacy data during clinical studies. Collecting and making publicly available as much data as possible on the target profile of drugs offer opportunities for drug repurposing, but may limit the commercial applications by patent applications. Certain clinical applications may be more feasible for repurposing than others because of marked differences in side effect tolerance. Other factors that ought to be considered when assessing drug repurposing opportunities include relevance to the disease in question and the intellectual property landscape.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The breast microenvironment can either retard or accelerate the events associated with progression of latent cancers. However, the actions of local physiological mediators in the context of breast cancers are poorly understood. Serotonin (5-HT) is a critical local regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the breast and other organs. Herein, we report complex alterations in the intrinsic mammary gland serotonin system of human breast cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Serotonin biosynthetic capacity was analyzed in human breast tumor tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry for tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1). Serotonin receptors (5-HT1-7) were analyzed in human breast tumors using the Oncomine database. Serotonin receptor expression, signal transduction, and 5-HT effects on breast cancer cell phenotype were compared in non-transformed and transformed human breast cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the context of the normal mammary gland, 5-HT acts as a physiological regulator of lactation and involution, in part by favoring growth arrest and cell death. This tightly regulated 5-HT system is subverted in multiple ways in human breast cancers. Specifically, TPH1 expression undergoes a non-linear change during progression, with increased expression during malignant progression. Correspondingly, the tightly regulated pattern of 5-HT receptors becomes dysregulated in human breast cancer cells, resulting in both ectopic expression of some isoforms and suppression of others. The receptor expression change is accompanied by altered downstream signaling of 5-HT receptors in human breast cancer cells, resulting in resistance to 5-HT-induced apoptosis, and stimulated proliferation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our data constitutes the first report of direct involvement of 5-HT in human breast cancer. Increased 5-HT biosynthetic capacity accompanied by multiple changes in 5-HT receptor expression and signaling favor malignant progression of human breast cancer cells (for example, stimulated proliferation, inappropriate cell survival). This occurs through uncoupling of serotonin from the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms of the normal mammary epithelium. The findings open a new avenue for identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and valuable new therapeutic targets for managing breast cancer.},

The traditional approach has been to use classical image analysis to quantify changes in cell morphology, which requires several non-trivial and independent analysis steps. Recently convolutional neural networks have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering good predictive performance and the possibility to replace traditional workflows with a single network architecture. In this study we applied the pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks ResNet50, InceptionV3 and InceptionResnetV2 to predict cell mechanisms of action in response to chemical perturbations for two cell profiling datasets from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection. These networks were pre-trained on ImageNet enabling much quicker model training. We obtain higher predictive accuracy than previously reported, between 95 and 97{\%} based on 'leave-one-compound-out' cross-validation. The ability to quickly and accurately distinguish between different cell morphologies from a scarce amount of labelled data illustrates the combined benefit of transfer learning and deep convolutional neural networks for interrogating cell-based images.},

Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources that transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the arena of drug-lead identification and optimization. Chemical information systems have been much more standardized over the years and are often called “registration systems,” with the best-known system being MACCS from MDL. To build the chemical system of the future, an object definition of the chemical sample is paramount. The object design by Purvis is one of the first object-based designs to be published for describing chemical information. The success of Chemoinformatics will depend on it being built on a solid foundation that will allow for flexibility as the discipline evolves. It is equally important for Chemoinformatics to be different from chemometrics and computational chemistry. The most critical factor for success will be the teaming of discovery scientists with information technologists to define the direction of Chemoinformatics.},

While machine learning (ML) has made immense progress in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, it has yet to offer comparable improvements over domain-expertise driven algorithms in the molecular sciences. In this paper, we propose new Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures for affinity prediction.

The growing availability of new types of drug features brings the opportunity of learning a more comprehensive and accurate drug similarity that represents the full spectrum of underlying drug relations. However, it is challenging to integrate these heterogeneous, noisy, nonlinear-related information to learn accurate similarity measures especially when labels are scarce. Moreover, there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we propose to learn accurate and interpretable similarity measures from multiple types of drug features. In particular, we model the integration using multi-view graph auto-encoders, and add attentive mechanism to determine the weights for each view with respect to corresponding tasks and features for better interpretability. Our model has flexible design for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Experimental results demonstrated significant predictive accuracy improvement.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ligand-based virtual screening using molecular shape is an important tool for researchers who wish to find novel chemical scaffolds in compound libraries. The Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) algorithm is capable of screening millions of compounds and is therefore suitable for usage in a web service. The algorithm however is agnostic of atom types and cannot discriminate compounds with similar shape but distinct pharmacophoric features. To solve this problem, an extension of USR called USRCAT, has been developed that includes pharmacophoric information whilst retaining the performance benefits of the original method.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The USRCAT extension is shown to outperform the traditional USR method in a retrospective virtual screening benchmark. Also, a relational database implementation is described that is capable of screening a million conformers in milliseconds and allows the inclusion of complex query parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: USRCAT provides a solution to the lack of atom type information in the USR algorithm. Researchers, particularly those with only limited resources, who wish to use ligand-based virtual screening in order to discover new hits, will benefit the most. Online chemical databases that offer a shape-based similarity method might also find advantage in using USRCAT due to its accuracy and performance. The source code is freely available and can easily be modified to fit specific needs.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of small molecules is important for developing probes and novel therapeutic agents in chemical biology and drug discovery. Increasingly, multiplexed small-molecule profiling assays allow simultaneous measurement of many biological response parameters for the same compound (e.g., expression levels for many genes or binding constants against many proteins). Although such methods promise to capture SARs with high granularity, few computational methods are available to support SAR analyses of high-dimensional compound activity profiles. Many of these methods are not generally applicable or reduce the activity space to scalar summary statistics before establishing SARs. In this article, we present a versatile computational method that automatically extracts interpretable SAR rules from high-dimensional profiling data. The rules connect chemical structural features of compounds to patterns in their biological activity profiles. We applied our method to data from novel cell-based gene-expression and imaging assays collected on more than 30,000 small molecules. Based on the rules identified for this data set, we prioritized groups of compounds for further study, including a novel set of putative histone deacetylase inhibitors.},

abstract = {High-throughput screening has become a mainstay of small-molecule probe and early drug discovery. The question of how to build and evolve efficient screening collections systematically for cell-based and biochemical screening is still unresolved. It is often assumed that chemical structure diversity leads to diverse biological performance of a library. Here, we confirm earlier results showing that this inference is not always valid and suggest instead using biological measurement diversity derived from multiplexed profiling in the construction of libraries with diverse assay performance patterns for cell-based screens. Rather than using results from tens or hundreds of completed assays, which is resource intensive and not easily extensible, we use high-dimensional image-based cell morphology and gene expression profiles. We piloted this approach using over 30,000 compounds. We show that small-molecule profiling can be used to select compound sets with high rates of activity and diverse biological performance.},

abstract = {Using a diverse collection of small molecules we recently found that compound sets from different sources (commercial; academic; natural) have different protein-binding behaviors, and these behaviors correlate with trends in stereochemical complexity for these compound sets. These results lend insight into structural features that synthetic chemists might target when synthesizing screening collections for biological discovery. We report extensive characterization of structural properties and diversity of biological performance for these compounds and expand comparative analyses to include physicochemical properties and three-dimensional shapes of predicted conformers. The results highlight additional similarities and differences between the sets, but also the dependence of such comparisons on the choice of molecular descriptors. Using a protein-binding dataset, we introduce an information-theoretic measure to assess diversity of performance with a constraint on specificity. Rather than relying on finding individual active compounds, this measure allows rational judgment of compound subsets as groups. We also apply this measure to publicly available data from ChemBank for the same compound sets across a diverse group of functional assays. We find that performance diversity of compound sets is relatively stable across a range of property values as judged by this measure, both in protein-binding studies and functional assays. Because building screening collections with improved performance depends on efficient use of synthetic organic chemistry resources, these studies illustrate an important quantitative framework to help prioritize choices made in building such collections.},

abstract = {Chemogenomics comprises a systematic relationship between targets and ligands that are used as target modulators in living systems such as cells or organisms. In recent years, data on small molecule-bioactivity relationships have become increasingly available, and consequently so have the number of approaches used to translate bioactivity data into knowledge. This review will focus on two aspects of chemogenomics. Firstly, in cases such as cell-based screens, the question of which target(s) a compound is modulating in order to cause the observed phenotype is crucial. In silico target prediction tools can suggest likely biological targets of small molecules via data mining in target-annotated chemical databases. This review presents some of the current tools available for this task and shows some sample applications relevant to a pharmaceutical industry setting. These applications are the prediction of false-positives in cell-based reporter gene assays, the prediction of targets by linking bioassay data with protein domain annotations, and the direct prediction of adverse reactions. Secondly, in recent years a shift from structure-derived chemical descriptors to biological descriptors has occurred. Here, the effect of a compound on a number of biological endpoints is used to make predictions about other properties, such as putative targets, associated adverse reactions, and pathways modulated by the compound. This review further summarizes these "performance" descriptors and their applications, focusing on gene expression profiles and high-content screening data. The advent of such biological fingerprints suggests that the field of drug discovery is currently at a crossroads, where single target bioassay results are supplanted by multidimensional biological fingerprints that reflect a new awareness of biological networks and polypharmacology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular structures can be represented as strings of special characters using SMILES. Since each molecule is represented as a string, the similarity between compounds can be computed using SMILES-based string similarity functions. Most previous studies on drug-target interaction prediction use 2D-based compound similarity kernels such as SIMCOMP. To the best of our knowledge, using SMILES-based similarity functions, which are computationally more efficient than the 2D-based kernels, has not been investigated for this task before.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we adapt and evaluate various SMILES-based similarity methods for drug-target interaction prediction. In addition, inspired by the vector space model of Information Retrieval we propose cosine similarity based SMILES kernels that make use of the Term Frequency (TF) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting approaches. We also investigate generating composite kernels by combining our best SMILES-based similarity functions with the SIMCOMP kernel. With this study, we provided a comparison of 13 different ligand similarity functions, each of which utilizes the SMILES string of molecule representation. Additionally, TF and TF-IDF based cosine similarity kernels are proposed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The more efficient SMILES-based similarity functions performed similarly to the more complex 2D-based SIMCOMP kernel in terms of AUC-ROC scores. The TF-IDF based cosine similarity obtained a better AUC-PR score than the SIMCOMP kernel on the GPCR benchmark data set. The composite kernel of TF-IDF based cosine similarity and SIMCOMP achieved the best AUC-PR scores for all data sets.},

abstract = {Molecular Informatics utilises many ideas and concepts to find relationships between molecules. The concept of similarity, where molecules may be grouped according to their biological effects or physicochemical properties has found extensive use in drug discovery. Some areas of particular interest have been in lead discovery and compound optimisation. For example, in designing libraries of compounds for lead generation, one approach is to design sets of compounds "similar" to known active compounds in the hope that alternative molecular structures are found that maintain the properties required while enhancing e.g. patentability, medicinal chemistry opportunities or even in achieving optimised pharmacokinetic profiles. Thus the practical importance of the concept of molecular similarity has grown dramatically in recent years. The predominant users are pharmaceutical companies, employing similarity methods in a wide range of applications e.g. virtual screening, estimation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/Tox) and prediction of physicochemical properties (solubility, partitioning etc.). In this perspective, we discuss the representation of molecular structure (descriptors), methods of comparing structures and how these relate to measured properties. This leads to the concept of molecular similarity, its various definitions and uses and how these have evolved in recent years. Here, we wish to evaluate and in some cases challenge accepted views and uses of molecular similarity. Molecular similarity, as a paradigm, contains many implicit and explicit assumptions in particular with respect to the prediction of the binding and efficacy of molecules at biological receptors. The fundamental observation is that molecular similarity has a context which both defines and limits its use. The key issues of solvation effects, heterogeneity of binding sites and the fundamental problem of the form of similarity measure to use are addressed.},

We demonstrated that, despite the apparent lack of activity, occasionally these compounds can result in potent hits with unique activity and clean safety profiles, which makes them valuable starting points for lead optimization efforts.

However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds.

abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of dis ease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leuke mia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n {\^{a}}€ " l)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed associa tion be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent sym metric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regu larities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for ar bitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general pro cedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extend ing it to nonlinear and mult {\^{A}}¡variatesituations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed.},

abstract = {One of the most commonly used clustering algorithms within the worldwide pharmaceutical industry is Jarvis−Patrick's (J−P) (Jarvis, R. A. IEEE Trans. Comput. 1973, C-22, 1025−1034). The implementation of J−P under Daylight software, using Daylight's fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity index, can deal with sets of 100 k molecules in a matter of a few hours. However, the J−P clustering algorithm has several associated problems which make it difficult to cluster large data sets in a consistent and timely manner. The clusters produced are greatly dependent on the choice of the two parameters needed to run J−P clustering, such that this method tends to produce clusters which are either very large and heterogeneous or homogeneous but too small. In any case, J−P always requires time-consuming manual tuning. This paper describes an algorithm which will identify dense clusters where similarity within each cluster reflects the Tanimoto value used for the clustering, and, more importantly, where the cluster centroid will be at least similar, at the given Tanimoto value, to every other molecule within the cluster in a consistent and automated manner. The similarity term used throughout this paper reflects the overall similarity between two given molecules, as defined by Daylight's fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity index.},

abstract = {Large-scale cellular imaging and phenotyping is a widely adopted strategy for understanding biological systems and chemical perturbations. Quantitative analysis of cellular images for identifying phenotypic changes is a key challenge within this strategy, and has recently seen promising progress with approaches based on deep neural networks. However, studies so far require either pre-segmented images as input or manual phenotype annotations for training, or both. To address these limitations, we have developed an unsupervised approach that exploits the inherent groupings within cellular imaging datasets to define surrogate classes that are used to train a multi-scale convolutional neural network. The trained network takes as input full-resolution microscopy images, and, without the need for segmentation, yields as output feature vectors that support phenotypic profiling. Benchmarked on two diverse benchmark datasets, the proposed approach yields accurate phenotypic predictions as well as compound potency estimates comparable to the state-of-the-art. More importantly, we show that the approach identifies novel cellular phenotypes not included in the manual annotation nor detected by previous studies.},

Attempts to reduce the number of efficacy- and safety-related failures by analysing possible links to the physicochemical properties of small-molecule drug candidates have been inconclusive because of the limited size of data sets from individual companies. Here, we describe the compilation and analysis of combined data on the attrition of drug candidates from AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The analysis reaffirms that control of physicochemical properties during compound optimization is beneficial in identifying compounds of candidate drug quality and indicates for the first time a link between the physicochemical properties of compounds and clinical failure due to safety issues. The results also suggest that further control of physicochemical properties is unlikely to have a significant effect on attrition rates and that additional work is required to address safety-related failures. Further cross-company collaborations will be crucial to future progress in this area.},

We describe the common distinguishing features of these breast cancer subtypes and explain how these features relate both to prognosis and to selection of the most appropriate therapy. Recent data indicate that breast tumors may originate from cancer stem cells. Consequently, inhibition of stem-cell self-renewal pathways should be explored because of the likelihood that residual stem cells might be resistant to current therapies.},

In particular, tumor spheroids of two cell lines glioblastoma (U-87 MG) and colorectal carcinoma (HCT 116) exhibited distinctive evolutions in their geometric shapes at late growth stages. Volumes of MCTS were accurately quantified using a voxel-based approach without presumptions of their geometries. In contrast, conventional diameter-based volume calculations assuming perfect spherical shape resulted in large quantification errors. Furthermore, we successfully detected necrotic regions within these tumor spheroids based on increased intrinsic optical attenuation, suggesting a promising alternative of label-free viability tests in tumor spheroids. Therefore, OCT can serve as a promising imaging modality to characterize morphological and physiological features of MCTS, showing great potential for high-throughput drug screening.},

abstract = {The traditional method for studying cancer in vitro is to grow immortalized cancer cells in two-dimensional monolayers on plastic. However, many cellular features are impaired in these artificial conditions, and large changes in gene expression compared to tumors have been reported. Three-dimensional cell culture models have become increasingly popular and are suggested to be better models than two-dimensional monolayers due to improved cell-to-cell contact and structures that resemble in vivo architecture. The aim of this study was to develop a simple high-throughput three-dimensional drug screening method and to compare drug responses in JIMT1 breast cancer cells when grown in two dimensions, in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) induced anchorage-independent three-dimensional models, and in Matrigel three-dimensional cell culture models. We screened 102 compounds with multiple concentrations and biological replicates for their effects on cell proliferation. The cells were either treated immediately upon plating, or they were allowed to grow in three-dimensional cultures for 4 days before the drug treatment. Large variations in drug responses were observed between the models indicating that comparisons of culture model-influenced drug sensitivities cannot be made based on the effects of a single drug. However, we show with the 63 most prominent drugs that, in general, JIMT1 cells grown on Matrigel were significantly more sensitive to drugs than cells grown in two-dimensional cultures, while the responses of cells grown in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) resembled those of the two-dimensional cultures. Furthermore, comparing the gene expression profiles of the cell culture models to xenograft tumors indicated that cells cultured in Matrigel and as xenografts most closely resembled each other. In this study, we also suggest that three-dimensional cultures can provide a platform for systematic experimentation of larger compound collections in a high-throughput mode and be used as alternatives to traditional two-dimensional screens for better comparability to the in vivo state.},

The assay is HTS compatible, providing high-quality, image-based, replicable data for multiple, co-cultured cell types. As proof of concept, we subjected colorectal carcinoma colonies in 3D soft agar to a mini screen of 1528 natural product compounds. Hit compounds from the primary screen were rescreened in an HTS 3D co-culture matrix containing colon stromal cells and cancer cells. By combining tumor cells and normal, nontransformed colon epithelial cells in one primary screening assay, we were able to obtain differential IC50 data, thereby distinguishing tumor-specific compounds from general cytotoxic compounds. Moreover, we were able to identify compounds that antagonized tumor colony formation in 3D only, highlighting the importance of this assay in identifying agents that interfere with 3D tumor structural growth. This screening platform provides a fast, simple, and robust method for identification of tumor-specific agents in a biologically relevant microenvironment.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture techniques are frequently used to model alterations in tissue architecture critically important for tumor development. Here, we report on a detailed comparison of a spheroid model of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) overexpressing cancer cells with the traditional monolayer culture. In 2D culture, HER2 and HER3 form heterodimers, whereas in multicellular spheroids HER2 homodimers are formed. These homodimers localize in membrane rafts, resulting in enhanced inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cells with trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting HER2. Within the tumor spheroids, HER2 homodimerization leads to enhanced activation of HER2 and results in a switch in signaling pathways from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Diminished PI3K signaling is accompanied by the activation of the integrin beta4/Rac1/PAK 2 signaling cascade. We propose that the described 3D culture system may better reflect some in vivo aspects of HER signaling and can be used to further improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of trastuzumab action. Furthermore, the described human multicellular tumor spheroids may allow identification of new targets for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer patients who currently benefit suboptimally from trastuzumab treatment.},

We employed a phenotypic screening paradigm on a panel of well-characterized cell lines derived from pediatric solid tumors against a collection of {\~{}}3,800 compounds spanning approved drugs and investigational agents. Specifically, we employed titration-based screening where compounds were tested at multiple concentrations for their effect on cell viability. Molecular and cellular target enrichment analysis indicated that numerous agents across different therapeutic categories and modes of action had an antiproliferative effect, notably antiparasitic/protozoal drugs with non-classic antineoplastic activity. Focusing on active compounds with dosing and safety information in children according to the Children{\&}rsquo;s Pharmacy Collaborative database, we identified compounds with therapeutic potential through further validation using 3D tumor spheroid models. Moreover, we show that antiparasitic agents induce cell death  via  apoptosis induction. This study demonstrates that our screening platform enables the identification of chemical agents with cytotoxic activity in pediatric cancer cell lines of which many have known safety/toxicity profiles in children. These agents constitute attractive candidates for efficacy studies in pre-clinical models of pediatric solid tumors.},

Analyses of genome-wide gene expression levels offer a first glance at which genes and pathways are affected in cell lines as compared to their tissues of origins. We have summarized available gene expression data and review how cell lines adapt to in vitro environments, to what degree they express markers of their tissues of origins and discuss how cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) cultures may have more physiological interactions with neighbouring cells and extracellular matrix. We will also discuss the interplay between malignant cells and stroma present in tumours but lacking in cell lines and how these differences might affect gene expression comparisons of cell lines to tumours.

Understanding the transcriptomes of cells grown in 2D and 3D cultures and how they compare to those of in vivo cells are important for improving cell line model systems and for the reconstituting of tissues in vitro. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many of the molecular subtypes and pathways found in tumors, suggesting that treatment of cell lines with candidate therapeutic compounds can guide identification of associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In a test of 77 therapeutic compounds, nearly all drugs showed differential responses across these cell lines, and approximately one third showed subtype-, pathway-, and/or genomic aberration-specific responses. These observations suggest mechanisms of response and resistance and may inform efforts to develop molecular assays that predict clinical response.},

Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of coding variants in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines identified by whole exome sequencing, providing a list of possible cancer specific variants for the community. Furthermore, we identify pharmacogenomic correlations between specific variants in genes such as TP53, BRAF, ERBBs, and ATAD5 and anticancer agents such as nutlin, vemurafenib, erlotinib, and bleomycin showing one of many ways the data could be used to validate and generate novel hypotheses for further investigation. As new cancer genes are identified through large-scale sequencing studies, the data presented here for the NCI-60 will be an invaluable resource for identifying cell lines with mutations in such genes for hypothesis-driven research.

As CCL panels continue to grow in size and diversity, many polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters and drug targets, as well as disease-related genes have been linked to altered drug sensitivity. However, identifying the correlation between this variability and pharmacological responses remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of cancer biology and the intricate interplay between cell lines and drug molecules. Here, we propose a network-based strategy that exploits information on gene expression and somatic mutations of CCLs to group cells according to their molecular similarity. We then identify genes that are characteristic of each cluster and correlate their status with drug response. We find that CCLs with similar characteristic active network regions present specific responses to certain drugs, and identify a limited set of genes that might be directly involved in drug sensitivity or resistance.},

abstract = {Despite the millions of dollars spent on target validation and drug optimization in preclinical models, most therapies still fail in phase III clinical trials. Our current model systems, or the way we interpret data from them, clearly do not have sufficient clinical predictive power. Current opinion suggests that this is because the cell lines and xenografts that are commonly used are inadequate models that do not effectively mimic and predict human responses. This has become such a widespread belief that it approaches dogma in the field of drug discovery and optimization and has spurred a surge in studies devoted to the development of more sophisticated animal models such as orthotopic patient-derived xenografts in an attempt to obtain more accurate estimates of whether particular cancers will respond to given treatments. Here, we explore the evidence that has led to the move away from the use of in vitro cell lines and toward various forms of xenograft models for drug screening and development. We review some of the pros and cons of each model and give an overview of ways in which the use of cell lines could be modified to improve the predictive capacity of this well-defined model.},

abstract = {How does the brain learn to recognize objects visually, and perform this difficult feat robustly in the face of many sources of ambiguity and variability? We present a computational model based on the biology of the relevant visual pathways that learns to reliably recognize 100 different object categories in the face of naturally occurring variability in location, rotation, size, and lighting. The model exhibits robustness to highly ambiguous, partially occluded inputs. Both the unified, biologically plausible learning mechanism and the robustness to occlusion derive from the role that recurrent connectivity and recurrent processing mechanisms play in the model. Furthermore, this interaction of recurrent connectivity and learning predicts that high-level visual representations should be shaped by error signals from nearby, associated brain areas over the course of visual learning. Consistent with this prediction, we show how semantic knowledge about object categories changes the nature of their learned visual representations, as well as how this representational shift supports the mapping between perceptual and conceptual knowledge. Altogether, these findings support the potential importance of ongoing recurrent processing throughout the brain's visual system and suggest ways in which object recognition can be understood in terms of interactions within and between processes over time.},

@article{VanDongen2008,
abstract = {A discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced, called the Markov Cluster Process or the MCL process. The process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the MCL algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Expansion corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic matrix, where {\$}k\backslashin\backslashN{\$}. Inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}r{\$}, {\$}r\backslashgeq 0{\$}, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}r M{\$} is obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. Several mathematical properties of the MCL process are established. Most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. The inflation operator {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}r{\$} maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. For {\$}r\backslashin\backslashN{\$} and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}r M{\$} is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. The spectrum of {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}} M{\$} is of the form {\$}\backslash{\{}0{\^{}}{\{}n-k{\}}, 1{\^{}}k\backslash{\}}{\$}, where k is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M, and n is the dimension of M. This attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.},

Successfully understanding systems at ever-increasing complexity is fundamental to advances in modern science and unraveling the functional details of cellular behavior is no exception.

These include: 1) visualizing intracellular protein activity with fluorescent markers, 2) high throughput (and automated) imaging of multilabeled cells in statistically significant numbers, and 3) machine intelligence to analyze subcellular image localization and pattern. Although not addressed here, the importance of combining cell-image-based information with detailed molecular structure and ligand-receptor binding models cannot be overlooked. Advanced molecular imaging techniques have the potential to impact cellular diagnostics for cancer screening, clinical correlations of tissue molecular patterns for cancer biology, and cellular molecular interactions for accelerating drug discovery.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a hemorrhagic stroke disease affecting up to 0.5{\%} of North Americans that has no approved nonsurgical treatment. A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning-based primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by ≈50{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: By identifying known drugs as potential therapeutics for CCM, we have decreased the time, cost, and risk of bringing treatments to patients. Each drug also prompts additional exploration of biomarkers of CCM disease. We further suggest that the structure-function screening platform presented here may be adapted and scaled to facilitate drug discovery for diverse loss-of-function genetic vascular disease.},

abstract = {Motivation: Identifying phenotypes based on high-content cellular images is challenging. Conventional image analysis pipelines for phenotype identification comprise multiple independent steps, with each step requiring method customization and adjustment of multiple parameters. Results: Here we present an approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network (M-CNN) that classifies, in a single cohesive step, cellular images into phenotypes by using directly and solely the images' pixel intensity values. The only parameters in the approach are the weights of the neural network, which are automatically optimized based on training images. The approach requires no a priori knowledge or manual customization, and is applicable to single-or multi-channel images displaying single or multiple cells. We evaluated the classification performance of the approach on eight diverse benchmark datasets. The approach yielded overall a higher classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art results, including those of other deep CNN architectures. In addition to using the network to simply obtain a yes-or-no prediction for a given phenotype, we use the probability outputs calculated by the network to quantitatively describe the phenotypes. Our study shows that these probability values correlate with chemical treatment concentrations. This finding validates further our approach and enables chemical treatment potency estimation via convolutional neural networks. Availability: The network specifications and solver definitions are provided in Supplementary Software 1.},

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},

Existing work in out- lier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real- world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding lo- cal outliers can be practical.},

In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

abstract = {Gene expression microarrays are widely used to better understand the complex$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbiological mechanisms inside cells. One of the main obstacles of applying statistical$\backslash$r$\backslash$nlearning algorithms to microarray data is the large gap between the number of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfeatures (p) and the number of available instances (n), i.e., the “large p, small n”$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchallenge. This thesis explores two ways to deal with this challenge.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nOne approach is to increase n by combining similarly appropriate microarray$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata sets together. This is appealing as there are now many publicly available$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmicroarray studies. The main problem of this approach is the batch effect, i.e., the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninfluence of non-biological factors on expression intensities that can confound the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbiological signal. As a result, combining gene expression studies without correcting$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfor batch effects may lead to misleading findings.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis thesis proposes a novel batch correction algorithm, called batch effect correction$\backslash$r$\backslash$nusing canonical correlation analysis (BECCA), that assumes the batch effect$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis due to additive independent confounding factors and so utilizes canonical$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncorrelation analysis to separate technical bias from the measured biological signal.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nWe compare BECCA to various existing batch correction algorithms using several$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreal-world gene expression studies and find that BECCA has similar performance.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe key advantage of utilizing BECCA, compared to other similar performing algorithms,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis its flexibility, as BECCA allows the user to adjust how much common$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsignal to preserve across the batches and how much batch related signal to remove$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom each one by changing the values of BECCA parameters.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe second approach to batch correction considers the wisdom of reducing p by$\backslash$r$\backslash$nselecting a subset of genes. Our experiments suggest that some genes in microarray$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata sets contain very little biological signal, i.e., including only these genes in the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncalculations makes all specimens highly correlated, regardless of their tissue of origin$\backslash$r$\backslash$nor disease state. It is, therefore, desirable to identify and remove these misleading$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngenes before conducing downstream analysis or batch correction. For this purpose,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwe propose an efficient algorithm to extend the single-study variance-based gene$\backslash$r$\backslash$nselection method to a multi-study gene selection algorithm. Our empirical results$\backslash$r$\backslash$nshow this feature selection algorithm outperforms other algorithms in reducing the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndestructive influence of batch effects.},

The feature values are then used to classify test images into a set of pre-defined image classes.

abstract = {Segmentation is the process of partitioning digital images into meaningful regions. The analysis of biological high content images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of both in vivo and in vitro microscopy techniques in the neurosciences, increased attention has been placed on the development of image analysis techniques. As experiments can produce large numbers of high bit depth images, automated processing methods have become necessary for handling these data sets. Thresholding, whereby a high bit depth image is converted into a binary image in order to identify a feature of interest, is one such standard automated technique; but the method of selecting an appropriate threshold value is far from standard. We present a novel algorithm, maximum correlation thresholding (MCT), that thresholds images accurately and efficiently without relying on any assumptions of the statistics of the image. As MCT produces thresholded images that preserve the most salient elements in the image, the algorithm performs as well as a trained user on a range of neurobiological data and in a variety of noisy conditions or when preprocessing steps preceded the thresholding operation. Our method will thus allow neuroscientists to automate image thresholding using a robust, computationally efficient algorithm, ultimately aiding in accurate image quantification and analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

They are at the center of recent progress on Artificial Intelligence and are of growing importance in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience since they enable the development of computational models that can deal with a large range of visually realistic stimuli and visual tasks. They have clear limitations but they also have enormous successes. There is also gradual, though incomplete, understanding of their inner workings. It seems unlikely that Deep Nets in their current form will be the best long-term solution either for building general purpose intelligent machines or for understanding the mind/brain, but it is likely that many aspects of them will remain. At present Deep Nets do very well on specific types of visual tasks and on specific benchmarked datasets. But Deep Nets are much less general purpose, flexible, and adaptive than the human visual system. Moreover, methods like Deep Nets may run into fundamental difficulties when faced with the enormous complexity of natural images. To illustrate our main points, while keeping the references small, this paper is slightly biased towards work from our group.},

abstract = {Significantly improved crop varieties are urgently needed to feed the rapidly growing human population under changing climates. While genome sequence information and excellent genomic tools are in place for major crop species, the systematic quantification of phenotypic traits or components thereof in a high-throughput fashion remains an enormous challenge. In order to help bridge the genotype to phenotype gap, we developed a comprehensive framework for highthroughput phenotype data analysis in plants, which enables the extraction of an extensive list of phenotypic traits from nondestructive plant imaging over time. As a proof of concept, we investigated the phenotypic components of the drought responses of 18 different barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivars during vegetative growth. We analyzed dynamic properties of trait expression over growth time based on 54 representative phenotypic features. The data are highly valuable to understand plant development and to further quantify growth and crop performance features. We tested various growth models to predict plant biomass accumulation and identified several relevant parameters that support biological interpretation of plant growth and stress tolerance. These image-based traits and model-derived parameters are promising for subsequent genetic mapping to uncover the genetic basis of complex agronomic traits. Taken together, we anticipate that the analytical framework and analysis results presented here will be useful to advance our views of phenotypic trait components underlying plant development and their responses to environmental cues.},

abstract = {Symmetric, dimeric daclatasvir (BMS-790052) is the clinical lead for a class of picomolar inhibitors of HCV replication. While specific, resistance-bearing mutations at positions 31 and 93 of domain I strongly suggest the viral NS5A as target, structural mechanism(s) for the drugs' activities and resistance remains unclear. Several previous models suggested symmetric binding modes relative to the homodimeric target; however, none can fully explain SAR details for this class. We present semiautomated workflows to model potential receptor conformations for docking. Surprisingly, ranking docked hits with our library-derived 3D-pharmacophore revealed two distinct asymmetric binding modes, at a conserved poly-proline region between 31 and 93, consistent with SAR. Interfering with protein-protein interactions at this membrane interface can explain potent inhibition of replication-complex formation, resistance, effects on lipid droplet distribution, and virion release. These detailed interaction models and proposed mechanisms of action will allow structure-based design of new NS5A directed compounds with higher barriers to HCV resistance.},

abstract = {To examine the mechanism by which metformin lowers endogenous glucose production in type 2 diabetic patients, we studied seven type 2 diabetic subjects, with fasting hyperglycemia (15.5 +/- 1.3 mmol/l), before and after 3 months of metformin treatment. Seven healthy subjects, matched for sex, age, and BMI, served as control subjects. Rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis, estimated by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were combined with estimates of contributions to glucose production of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, measured by labeling of blood glucose by 2H from ingested 2H2O. Glucose production was measured using [6,6-2H2]glucose. The rate of glucose production was twice as high in the diabetic subjects as in control subjects (0.70 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) min(-1), P {\textless} 0.0001). Metformin reduced that rate by 24{\%} (to 0.53 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.0009) and fasting plasma glucose concentration by 30{\%} (to 10.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/l, P = 0.0002). The rate of gluconeogenesis was three times higher in the diabetic subjects than in the control subjects (0.59 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) min(-1) and metformin reduced that rate by 36{\%} (to 0.38 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.01). By the 2H2O method, there was a twofold increase in rates of gluconeogenesis in diabetic subjects (0.42 +/- 0.04 mmol m(-2) x min(-1), which decreased by 33{\%} after metformin treatment (0.28 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.0002). There was no glycogen cycling in the control subjects, but in the diabetic subjects, glycogen cycling contributed to 25{\%} of glucose production and explains the differences between the two methods used. In conclusion, patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes have increased rates of endogenous glucose production, which can be attributed to increased rates of gluconeogenesis. Metformin lowered the rate of glucose production in these patients through a reduction in gluconeogenesis.},

abstract = {An ensemble consists of a set of individually trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Pre-vious research has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting (Freund {\&} Schapire, 1996; Schapire, 1990) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensem-bles. In this paper we evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithm. Our results clearly indicate a number of conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single classifier, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other hand, Boosting can cre-ate ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier – especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that the performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of the data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance. Finally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the gain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined; however, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting decision trees.},

Yet the number of new drugs approved per billion US dollars spent on RD has halved roughly every 9 years since 1950, falling around 80-fold in inflation-adjusted terms. There have been many proposed solutions to the problem of declining RD efficiency. However, their apparent lack of impact so far and the contrast between improving inputs and declining output in terms of the number of new drugs make it sensible to ask whether the underlying problems have been correctly diagnosed. Here, we discuss four factors that we consider to be primary causes, which we call the 'better than the Beatles' problem; the 'cautious regulator' problem; the 'throw money at it' tendency; and the 'basic research-brute force' bias. Our aim is to provoke a more systematic analysis of the causes of the decline in RD efficiency.},

abstract = {The presence of systematic noise in images in high-throughput microscopy experiments can significantly impact the accuracy of downstream results. Among the most common sources of systematic noise is non-homogeneous illumination across the image field. This often adds an unacceptable level of noise, obscures true quantitative differences and precludes biological experiments that rely on accurate fluorescence intensity measurements. In this paper, we seek to quantify the improvement in the quality of high-content screen readouts due to software-based illumination correction. We present a straightforward illumination correction pipeline that has been used by our group across many experiments. We test the pipeline on real-world high-throughput image sets and evaluate the performance of the pipeline at two levels: (a) Z'-factor to evaluate the effect of the image correction on a univariate readout, representative of a typical high-content screen, and (b) classification accuracy on phenotypic signatures derived from the images, representative of an experiment involving more complex data mining. We find that applying the proposed post-hoc correction method improves performance in both experiments, even when illumination correction has already been applied using software associated with the instrument. To facilitate the ready application and future development of illumination correction methods, we have made our complete test data sets as well as open-source image analysis pipelines publicly available. This software-based solution has the potential to improve outcomes for a wide-variety of image-based HTS experiments.},

abstract = {Despite the abundance of large-scale molecular and drug-response data, our ability to extract the underlying mechanisms of diseases and treatment efficacy has been in general limited. Machine learning algorithms applied to those data sets most often are used to provide predictions without interpretation, or reveal single drug-gene association and fail to derive robust insights. We propose to use Macau, a bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the association between the drug targets and signaling pathway activations. A typical insight would be: Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X. We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using signaling pathways' activities as cell line input and nominal targets as drug input. The interactions between the drug target and the pathway activity can guide a tissue specific treatment strategy by for example suggesting how to modulate a certain protein to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues. Such an analysis of interactions across tissues might help drug repurposing and patient stratification strategies.},

By this approach, a complete yeast genetic mutant array is crossed with fluorescent reporters and imaged on membranes at high density and contrast. Importantly, SGPA enables quantification of phenotypes that are not readily detectable in ordinary genetic analysis of cell fitness. We benchmark SGPA by examining two fundamental biological phenotypes: first, we explore glucose repression, in which SGPA identifies a requirement for the Mediator complex and a role for the CDK8/kinase module in regulating transcription. Second, we examine selective protein quality control, in which SGPA identifies most known quality control factors along with U34tRNA modification, which acts independently of proteasomal degradation to limit misfolded protein production. Integration of SGPA with other fluorescent readouts will enable genetic dissection of a wide range of biological pathways and conditions. Quantifying an organism's response to gene disruptions enables mapping of molecular pathways. Existing genetic screens are largely constrained to simple “fitness” or “survival” readouts and blind to subtler changes. Jaeger et al. present screening technology to obtain data across many phenotypes and conditions rapidly, increasing resolution of pathway maps.},

abstract = {High cancer drug development attrition rates have provoked considerable debate about whether the two-dimensional tumor growth inhibition high-throughput screening assays used in pre-clinical lead discovery adequately reflect solid tumor complexity. We used automated high-content screening image acquisition and analysis methods to compare fluorescent drug uptake, accumulation, and distribution in Cal33 and FaDu head and neck cancer (HNC) monolayer and multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) models. Ellipticine, idarubicin, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin were studied because of their fluorescent properties and broad anti-tumor activities. HNC MCTSs were generated in 384-well ultra-low attachment plates where compound exposure, image acquisition, and analysis could be performed in situ. Fluorescent drug accumulation in Cal33 monolayer and MCTS cultures was linear with respect to concentration, and appeared to achieve steady-state levels within 10-15 min of drug exposure, which were maintained through 30-45 min. Drug accumulation in monolayers was independent of cell number and/or density, and every cell achieved uniform drug concentrations. In MCTSs, however, drug accumulation increased as the number of cells and sizes of the MCTSs became bigger. Drugs exhibited restricted penetration and distribution gradients, accumulating preferentially in cells in the outer layers of MCTSs relative to those in the inner cores. Cal33 monolayers were 6-, 20-, 10-, and 16-fold more sensitive than MCTSs to growth inhibition by ellipticine, idarubicin, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, respectively. In Cal33 MCTSs exposed to ellipticine or doxorubicin for 24 h, MCTSs were smaller and although they still exhibited drug penetration and distribution gradients, the fluorescent intensity difference between outer and inner cells was reduced. After a 24 h exposure, both drugs had penetrated throughout FaDu MCTSs, consistent with drug-induced death of peripheral cell layers enhancing drug penetration. The increased resistance of MCTS cultures and their ability to recapitulate drug penetration and distribution gradients argues strongly for the deployment of these more physiological models in cancer lead discovery. MCTSs have the potential to enhance the correlation between in vitro potencies and in vivo efficacy, and ultimately may lead to improved cancer drug approval rates.},

Once identified, unsupervised clustering and principle component analysis of texture-based phenotypic profiles were applied to group similar phenotypes.

abstract = {AbstractMosaic analysis, in which two or more populations of cells with differing genotypes are studied in a single animal, is a powerful approach to study developmental mechanisms and gene function in vivo. Over recent years several genetic methods have been developed to achieve mosaicism in zebrafish, but despite their advances, limitations remain and different approaches and further refinements are warranted. Here, we describe an alternative approach to create somatic mosaicism in zebrafish that relies on the instability of microsatellite sequences during replication. We placed the coding sequences of various marker proteins behind a microsatellite and out-of-frame; in vivo frameshifting into the proper reading frame results in expression of the protein in random individual cells that are surrounded by wildtype cells. We optimized this approach for the binary Gal4-UAS expression system by generating a driver line and effector lines that stochastically express Gal4-VP16 or UAS:H2A-EGFP and self-maintaining UAS:H2A-EGFP-Kaloop, respectively. To demonstrate the utility of this system we stochastically expressed a constitutively active form of the human oncogene H-RAS and show the occurrence of hyperpigmentation and sporadic tumors within 5 days. Our data demonstrate that inducing somatic mosaicism via microsatellite instability can be a valuable approach for mosaic analysis and tumor induction in Danio rerio.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a high risk of relapse and there are few chemotherapy options. Although 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) signaling pathways have been suggested as potential targets for anti-cancer drug development, the mechanism responsible for the action of 5-HT in TNBC remains unknown. METHODS Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution. siRNA transfection was used to assess involvement of genes in cancer invasion, which were identified by Matrigel transwell invasion assay. Levels of 5-HT and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured using ELISA kits. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and mouse tumor model were used to investigate the in vivo effects of SB269970, a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and BJ-1113, a novel synthetic compound. RESULTS TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC-1395, and Hs578T) expressed higher levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) than hormone-responsive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D). In MDA-MB-231 cells, 5-HT promoted invasion and proliferation via 5-HT7 receptor, and interestingly, the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was stronger than its effect on proliferation. Likewise, downstream signaling pathways of 5-HT7 differed during invasion and proliferation, that is, G$\alpha$-activated cAMP and G$\beta$$\gamma$-activated kinase signaling during invasion, and G$\beta$$\gamma$-activated PI3K/Akt signaling during proliferation. Also, 5-HT increased the protein expressions of TPH1 and VEGF in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results provide insight of the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on breast cancer progression; 5-HT was found to act more strongly during the first stage of metastasis (during invasion and migration) than during the later proliferative phase after local invasion. Interestingly, these actions of 5-HT were inhibited by BJ-1113, a 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol analog. BJ-1113 blocked intracellular signaling pathways initiated by 5-HT7 receptor activation, and exhibited anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activities against MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of BJ-1113 against MDA-MB-231 tumor growth was greater than that of SB269970, a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS 5-HT7 receptor which mediates 5-HT-induced cancer progression is a potential therapeutic target in TNBC, and BJ-1113 offers a novel scaffold for the development of anti-cancer agents against TNBC.},

abstract = {Phenotypic cell-based assays have proven to be efficient at discovering first-in-class therapeutic drugs mainly because they allow for scanning a wide spectrum of possible targets at once. However, despite compelling methodological advances, posterior identification of a compound's mechanism of action (MOA) has remained difficult and highly refractory to automated analyses. Methods such as the cell painting assay and multiplexing fluorescent dyes to reveal broadly relevant cellular components were recently suggested for MOA prediction. We demonstrated that adding fluorescent dyes to a single assay has limited impact on MOA prediction accuracy, as monitoring only the nuclei stain could reach compelling levels of accuracy. This observation suggested that multiplexed measurements are highly correlated and nuclei stain could possibly reflect the general state of the cell. We then hypothesized that combining unrelated and possibly simple cell-based assays could bring a solution that would be biologically and technically more relevant to predict a drug target than using a single assay multiplexing dyes. We show that such a combination of past screen data could rationally be reused in screening facilities to train an ensemble classifier to predict drug targets and prioritize a possibly large list of unknown compound hits at once.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a critical local regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the breast and exerts its actions through a number of receptors. Dysregulation of serotonin signaling is reported to contribute to breast cancer pathophysiology by enhancing cell proliferation and promoting resistance to apoptosis. Preliminary analyses indicated that the potent 5-HT1B/1D serotonin receptor agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT), a triptan-like molecule, induced cell death in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, we synthesized a series of novel alkyloxytryptamine analogues, several of which decreased the viability of various human cancer cell lines. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses showed that compounds 6 and 10 induced apoptosis and interfered with signaling pathways that regulate protein translation and survival, such as the Akt/mTOR pathway, in triple-negative breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {The paradigm of molecular histopathology is shifting from a single-marker immunohistochemistry towards multiplexed detection of markers to better understand the complex pathological processes. However, there are no systems allowing multiplexed IHC (mIHC) with high-resolution whole-slide tissue imaging and analysis, yet providing feasible throughput for routine use. We present an mIHC platform combining fluorescent and chromogenic staining with automated whole-slide imaging and integrated whole-slide image analysis, enabling simultaneous detection of six protein markers and nuclei, and automatic quantification and classification of hundreds of thousands of cells in situ in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. In the first proof-of-concept, we detected immune cells at cell-level resolution (n = 128,894 cells) in human prostate cancer, and analysed T cell subpopulations in different tumour compartments (epithelium vs. stroma). In the second proof-of-concept, we demonstrated an automatic classification of epithelial cell populations (n = 83,558) and glands (benign vs. cancer) in prostate cancer with simultaneous analysis of androgen receptor (AR) and alpha-methylacyl-CoA (AMACR) expression at cell-level resolution. We conclude that the open-source combination of 8-plex mIHC detection, whole-slide image acquisition and analysis provides a robust tool allowing quantitative, spatially resolved whole-slide tissue cytometry directly in formalin-fixed human tumour tissues for improved characterization of histology and the tumour microenvironment.},

abstract = {Background Patients with refractory or relapsed haematological malignancies have few treatment options and short survival times. Identification of effective therapies with genomic-based precision medicine is hampered by intratumour heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of the contribution of various mutations within specific cancer phenotypes. Ex-vivo drug-response profiling in patient biopsies might aid effective treatment identification; however, proof of its clinical utility is limited. Methods We investigated the feasibility and clinical impact of multiparametric, single-cell, drug-response profiling in patient biopsies by immunofluorescence, automated microscopy, and image analysis, an approach we call pharmacoscopy. First, the ability of pharmacoscopy to separate responders from non-responders was evaluated retrospectively for a cohort of 20 newly diagnosed and previously untreated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Next, 48 patients with aggressive haematological malignancies were prospectively evaluated for pharmacoscopy-guided treatment, of whom 17 could receive the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in pharmacoscopy-treated patients, as compared with their own progression-free survival for the most recent regimen on which they had progressive disease. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03096821. Findings Pharmacoscopy retrospectively predicted the clinical response of 20 acute myeloid leukaemia patients to initial therapy with 88{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} accuracy. In this interim analysis, 15 (88{\%}) of 17 patients receiving pharmacoscopy-guided treatment had an overall response compared with four (24{\%}) of 17 patients with their most recent regimen (odds ratio 24{\textperiodcentered}38 [95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}99–125{\textperiodcentered}4], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0013). 12 (71{\%}) of 17 patients had a progression-free survival ratio of 1{\textperiodcentered}3 or higher, and median progression-free survival increased by four times, from 5{\textperiodcentered}7 (95{\%} CI 4{\textperiodcentered}1–12{\textperiodcentered}1) weeks to 22{\textperiodcentered}6 (7{\textperiodcentered}4–34{\textperiodcentered}0) weeks (hazard ratio 3{\textperiodcentered}14 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}37–7{\textperiodcentered}22], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0075). Interpretation Routine clinical integration of pharmacoscopy for treatment selection is technically feasible, and led to improved treatment of patients with aggressive refractory haematological malignancies in an initial patient cohort, warranting further investigation.

abstract = {We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in the set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.},

abstract = {Phenotypic cell-based assays have proven to be efficient at discovering first-in-class therapeutic drugs mainly because they allow for scanning a wide spectrum of possible targets at once. However, despite compelling methodological advances, posterior identification of a compound's mechanism of action (MOA) has remained difficult and highly refractory to automated analyses. Methods such as the cell painting assay and multiplexing fluorescent dyes to reveal broadly relevant cellular components were recently suggested for MOA prediction. We demonstrated that adding fluorescent dyes to a single assay has limited impact on MOA prediction accuracy, as monitoring only the nuclei stain could reach compelling levels of accuracy. This observation suggested that multiplexed measurements are highly correlated and nuclei stain could possibly reflect the general state of the cell. We then hypothesized that combining unrelated and possibly simple cell-based assays could bring a solution that would be biologically and technically more relevant to predict a drug target than using a single assay multiplexing dyes. We show that such a combination of past screen data could rationally be reused in screening facilities to train an ensemble classifier to predict drug targets and prioritize a possibly large list of unknown compound hits at once.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Cell lines are extremely useful tools in breast cancer research. Their key benefits include a high degree of control over experimental variables and reproducibility. However, the advantages must be balanced against the limitations of modelling such a complex disease in vitro. Informed selection of cell line(s) for a given experiment now requires essential knowledge about molecular and phenotypic context in the culture dish. METHODS: We performed multidimensional profiling of 36 widely used breast cancer cell lines that were cultured under standardised conditions. Flow cytometry and digital immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of 14 classical breast cancer biomarkers related to intrinsic molecular profiles and differentiation states: EpCAM, CD24, CD49f, CD44, ER, AR, HER2, EGFR, E-cadherin, p53, vimentin, and cytokeratins 5, 8/18 and 19. RESULTS: This cell-by-cell analysis revealed striking heterogeneity within cultures of individual lines that would be otherwise obscured by analysing cell homogenates, particularly amongst the triple-negative lines. High levels of p53 protein, but not RNA, were associated with somatic mutations (p = 0.008). We also identified new subgroups using the nanoString PanCancer Pathways panel (730 transcripts representing 13 canonical cancer pathways). Unsupervised clustering identified five groups: luminal/HER2, immortalised ('normal'), claudin-low and two basal clusters, distinguished mostly by baseline expression of TGF-beta and PI3-kinase pathway genes. CONCLUSION: These features are compared with other published genotype and phenotype information in a user-friendly reference table to help guide selection of the most appropriate models for in vitro and in vivo studies, and as a framework for classifying new patient-derived cancer cell lines and xenografts.},

abstract = {Image-based screening is a powerful technique to reveal how chemical, genetic, and environmental perturbations affect cellular state. Its potential is restricted by the current analysis algorithms that target a small number of cellular phenotypes and rely on expert-engineered image features. Newer algorithms that learn how to represent an image are limited by the small amount of labeled data for ground-truth, a common problem for scientific projects. We demonstrate a sensitive and robust method for distinguishing cellular phenotypes that requires no additional ground-truth data or training. It achieves state-of-the-art performance classifying drugs by similar molecular mechanism, using a Deep Metric Network that has been pre-trained on consumer images and a transformation that improves sensitivity to biological variation. However, our method is not limited to classification into predefined categories. It provides a continuous measure of the similarity between cellular phenotypes that can also detect subtle differences such as from increasing dose. The rich, biologically-meaningful image representation that our method provides can help therapy development by supporting high-throughput investigations, even exploratory ones, with more sophisticated and disease-relevant models.},

This renaissance was triggered by analyses that suggested that phenotypic screening is a superior strategy to discover first-in-class drugs. Despite these promises and considerable investments, pharmaceutical research organizations have encountered considerable challenges with the approach. Few success stories have emerged in the past 5 years and companies are questioning their investment in this area. In this contribution, we outline what we have learned about success factors and challenges of phenotypic screening. We then describe how our efforts in phenotypic screening have influenced our approach to drug discovery in general.

While there is longstanding evidence for the potential of chemical exposures to adversely affect EC function and vascular development, the hazard potential of chemicals with respect to vascular effects is not routinely evaluated in safety assessments. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs promise to provide a physiologically relevant, organotypic culture model that is amenable for high-throughput (HT) EC toxicant screening and may represent a viable alternative to traditional in vitro models, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). To evaluate the utility of iPSC-ECs for multidimensional HT toxicity profiling of chemicals, both iPSC-ECs and HUVECs were exposed to selected positive (angiogenesis inhibitors, cytotoxic agents) and negative compounds in concentration response for either 16 or 24 h in a 384-well plate format. Furthermore, chemical effects on vascularization were quantified using EC angiogenesis on biological (Geltrex™) and synthetic (SP-105 angiogenesis hydrogel) extracellular matrices. Cellular toxicity was assessed using high-content live cell imaging and the CellTiter-Glo{\textregistered} assay. Assay performance indicated good to excellent assay sensitivity and reproducibility for both cell types investigated. Both iPSC-derived ECs and HUVECs formed tube-like structures on Geltrex™ and hydrogel, an effect that was inhibited by angiogenesis inhibitors and cytotoxic agents in a concentration-dependent manner. The quality of HT assays in HUVECs was generally higher than that in iPSC-ECs. Altogether, this study demonstrates the capability of ECs for comprehensive assessment of the biological effects of chemicals on vasculature in a HT compatible format.},

abstract = {Human cancer cell lines are used in research to study the biology of cancer and to test cancer treatments. Recently there are already some large panels of several hundred human cancer cell lines which are characterized with genomic and pharmacological data. The ability to predict drug responses using these pharmacogenomics data can facilitate the development of precision cancer medicines. Although several methods have been developed to address the drug response prediction, there are many challenges in obtaining accurate prediction. Based on the fact that similar cell lines and similar drugs exhibit similar drug responses, we adopted a similarity-regularized matrix factorization (SRMF) method to predict anticancer drug responses of cell lines using chemical structures of drugs and baseline gene expression levels in cell lines. Specifically, chemical structural similarity of drugs and gene expression profile similarity of cell lines were considered as regularization terms, which were incorporated to the drug response matrix factorization model. We first demonstrated the effectiveness of SRMF using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical similarity-based methods. Furthermore, we applied it to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets, and performance of SRMF exceeds three state-of-the-art methods. We also applied SRMF to estimate the missing drug response values in the GDSC dataset. Even though SRMF does not specifically model mutation information, it could correctly predict drug-cancer gene associations that are consistent with existing data, and identify novel drug-cancer gene associations that are not found in existing data as well. SRMF can also aid in drug repositioning. The newly predicted drug responses of GDSC dataset suggest that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was sensitive to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and expression of AK1RC3 and HINT1 may be adjunct markers of cell line sensitivity to rapamycin. Our analysis showed that the proposed data integration method is able to improve the accuracy of prediction of anticancer drug responses in cell lines, and can identify consistent and novel drug-cancer gene associations compared to existing data as well as aid in drug repositioning.},

Here, we describe the development of a robust precision cancer care platform that integrates whole-exome sequencing with a living biobank that enables high-throughput drug screens on patient-derived tumor organoids. To date, 56 tumor-derived organoid cultures and 19 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been established from the 769 patients enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved clinical trial. Because genomics alone was insufficient to identify therapeutic options for the majority of patients with advanced disease, we used high-throughput drug screening to discover effective treatment strategies. Analysis of tumor-derived cells from four cases, two uterine malignancies and two colon cancers, identified effective drugs and drug combinations that were subsequently validated using 3-D cultures and PDX models.

abstract = {The intramembrane protease signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a) is a potential drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases due to an essential role in B cells and dendritic cells. To screen a library of 1.4 million compounds for inhibitors of SPPL2a, we developed an imaging assay detecting nuclear translocation of the proteolytically released cytosolic substrate fragment. The state-of-the-art hit calling approach based on nuclear translocation resulted in numerous false-positive hits, mainly interrupting intracellular protein trafficking. To filter the false positives, we extracted 340 image-based readouts and developed a novel multiparametric analysis method that successfully triaged the primary hit list. The identified scaffolds were validated by demonstrating activity on endogenous SPPL2a and substrate CD74/p8 in B cells. The multiparametric analysis discovered diverse cellular phenotypes and provided profiles for the whole library. The principle of the presented imaging assay, the screening strategy, and multiparametric analysis are potentially applicable in future screening campaigns.},

abstract = {Small-molecule compounds are widely used as biological research tools and therapeutic drugs. Therefore, uncovering novel targets of these compounds should provide insights that are valuable in both basic and clinical studies. I developed a method for image-based compound profiling by quantitating the effects of compounds on signal transduction and vesicle trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Using six signal transduction molecules and two markers of vesicle trafficking, 570 image features were obtained and subjected to multivariate analysis. Fourteen compounds that affected EGFR or its pathways were classified into four clusters, based on their phenotypic features. Surprisingly, one EGFR inhibitor (CAS 879127-07-8) was classified into the same cluster as nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizer. In fact, this compound directly depolymerized microtubules. These results indicate that CAS 879127-07-8 could be used as a chemical probe to investigate both the EGFR pathway and microtubule dynamics. The image-based multivariate analysis developed herein has potential as a powerful tool for discovering unexpected drug properties.},

Application of these methods to compound profiling across high-content assays incorporating well-characterized cells representing known molecular subtypes of disease supports the development of personalized healthcare strategies without prior knowledge of a drug target.

abstract = {Phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) approaches do not rely on knowledge of the identity of a specific drug target or a hypothesis about its role in disease, in contrast to the target-based strategies that have been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry in the past three decades. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence in interest in PDD approaches based on their potential to address the incompletely understood complexity of diseases and their promise of delivering first-in-class drugs, as well as major advances in the tools for cell-based phenotypic screening. Nevertheless, PDD approaches also have considerable challenges, such as hit validation and target deconvolution. This article focuses on the lessons learned by researchers engaged in PDD in the pharmaceutical industry and considers the impact of ‘omics' knowledge in defining a cellular disease phenotype in the era of precision medicine, introducing the concept of a chain of translatability. We particularly aim to identify features and areas in which PDD can best deliver value to drug discovery portfolios and can contribute to the identification and the development of novel medicines, and to illustrate the challenges and uncertainties that are associated with PDD in order to help set realistic expectations with regard to its benefits and costs.},

A widely applied computational approach infers putative targets of new active molecules on the basis of their chemical similarity to compounds with activity against known targets. Herein, we introduce a molecular scaffold-based variant for similarity-based target deconvolution from chemical cancer cell line screens that were used as a model system for phenotypic assays. A new scaffold type was used for substructure-based similarity assessment, termed analog series-based (ASB) scaffold. Compared with conventional scaffolds and compound-based similarity calculations, target assignment centered on ASB scaffolds resulting from screening hits and bioactive reference compounds restricted the number of target hypotheses in a meaningful way and lead to a significant enrichment of known cancer targets among candidates.},

abstract = {1 * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal disease causing progressive loss of motor neurons, still has no effective treatment. We developed a phenotypic screen to repurpose existing drugs using ALS motor neuron survival as readout. Motor neurons were generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an ALS patient with a mutation in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Results of the screen showed that more than half of the hits targeted the Src/c-Abl signaling pathway. Src/c-Abl inhibitors increased survival of ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons in vitro. Knockdown of Src or c-Abl with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) also rescued ALS motor neuron degeneration. One of the hits, bosutinib, boosted autophagy, reduced the amount of misfolded mutant SOD1 protein, and attenuated altered expression of mitochondrial genes. Bosutinib also increased survival in vitro of ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients with sporadic ALS or other forms of familial ALS caused by mutations in TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or repeat expansions in C9orf72. Furthermore, bosutinib treatment modestly extended survival of a mouse model of ALS with an SOD1 mutation, suggesting that Src/c-Abl may be a potentially useful target for developing new drugs to treat ALS.},

abstract = {Resolving the spatial distribution of the human proteome at a subcellular level can greatly increase our understanding of human biology and disease. Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein distribution, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell.},

@article{Arora2017,
abstract = {Mammalian cells have two fundamentally different states, proliferative and quiescent, but our understanding of how and why cells switch between these states is limited. We previously showed that actively proliferating populations contain a subpopulation that enters quiescence (G0) in an apparently stochastic manner. Using single-cell time-lapse imaging of CDK2 activity and DNA damage, we now show that unresolved endogenous replication stress in the previous (mother) cell cycle prompts p21-dependent entry of daughter cells into quiescence immediately after mitosis. Furthermore, the amount of time daughter cells spend in quiescence is correlated with the extent of inherited damage. Our study thus links replication errors in one cell cycle to the fate of daughter cells in the subsequent cell cycle. More broadly, this work reveals that entry into quiescence is not purely stochastic but has a strong deterministic component arising from a memory of events that occurred in the previous generation(s).},

@article{Dizeyi2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increase in the number of serotonin (5-HT) releasing neuroendocrine (NE) cells has been shown to be correlated with tumor progression, loss of androgen dependence, and poor prognosis. Serotonin is a well-known mitogen which mediates a wide variety of physiological effects via multiple receptors, of which receptor subtype 1 (5-HTR1) has been identified in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. Recently, 5-HT has been found to show growth-promoting activity and to be functionally related to oncogenes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Localization, protein content, and mRNA expression of 5-HTR subtype 1A, 1B, and 1D was studied in prostatic tissue (35 patients), metastases, PC cell lines, a benign prostatic stromal cell line (human prostate cell preparation (hPCP)), and xenografts of PC-3 cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting, and RT-PCR, respectively. The growth-inhibition effect of a 5-HT1A antagonist (NAN-190) on PC cell lines was studied using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. RESULTS: A strong immunoreaction of 5-HTR1A and 1B was demonstrated in high-grade tumor cells (35/35) and a small number of BPH cells, whereas 5-HTR1D was confined to vascular endothelial cells. 5-HTR1A was also demonstrated in PC cells metastasized to lymph node and bone, PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, and in xenografts of PC-3 cells and hPCP. Western blot analysis gave strong bands from PC tissue extracts compared to BPH tissue. Using RT-PCR, 5-HTR1A mRNA was demonstrated in all PC cell lines. An antagonist of 5-HTR1A (NAN-190) inhibited the growth of PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP cells but not of hPCP cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating an overexpression of 5-HTR subtypes 1A and 1B in PC cells, especially in high-grade tumors. Moreover, 5-HT stimulates proliferation of PC cells and 5-HTR1A antagonists inhibit proliferation. Thus, we propose that 5-HT has an important role in tumor progression, especially in the androgen-independent state of the disease. The design of specific antagonists for this type of receptor might be useful for the growth control of androgen-independent tumors.},

abstract = {Serotonin exhibits multiple non-neural functions involved in essential hypertension, early embryogenesis, follicle maturation and behaviour. The growth stimulatory effects of the neurotransmitter have been described for a variety of cell types. 5-HT was found to induce migration of the human prostate cancer cell lines – PC-3 and Du145 – and several 5-HT1Aantagonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors were reported to inhibit the growth of different tumour cell lines in vitro. Recent studies suggest that neurogenesis is involved in the action of antidepressants and an involvement of antidepressants in adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been demonstrated. Antidepressants also exhibit neuroprotective activity, which could be connected to their antidepressant activity. However, it has been reported that certain antidepressants may induce apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. In the present paper the neuroprotective and proapoptotic activities of serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs and TCAs), as well as 5-HT1Areceptor ligands are summarized and discussed based on biochemical transduction pathways associated with these activities.},

abstract = {Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is a widely used antidepressant agent. Here, we show that sertraline also exhibits antiproliferative activity. Exposure to sertraline leads to a concentration-dependent decrease in protein synthesis. Moreover, polysome profile analysis of sertraline-treated cells shows a reduction in polysome content and a concomitant increase in 80S ribosomes. The inhibition in translation caused by sertraline is associated with decreased levels of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, altered localization of eIF4E, and increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The latter event leads to increased REDD1 expression, which in turn impinges on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by affecting TSC1/2 signaling. Sertraline also independently targets the mTOR signaling pathway downstream of Rheb. In the Emu-myc murine lymphoma model where carcinogenesis is driven by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) inactivation, sertraline is able to enhance chemosensitivity to doxorubicin. Our results indicate that sertraline exerts antiproliferative activity by targeting the mTOR signaling pathway in a REDD1-dependent manner.},

@article{Gil-Ad1992,
abstract = {Evidence has been provided of the anti-proliferative activity of certain antidepressants, mainly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We tested the effect of different antidepressants on cell viability and proliferation of human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HT29 and the multi-drug resistant (MDR) LS1034. The SSRIs, paroxetine and sertraline, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability and proliferation in the two cell lines (IC50 8-15 micro M). When compared to cytotoxic agents e.g. doxorubicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the SSRIs showed comparable activity (HT29) or a superior effect (LS1034). Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that the two SSRIs arrested cells at the G0/G1 stage and stimulated DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. The SSRIs (10 and 20 microM) increased caspase-3 activation. Western blot analysis showed an increase after 24 h in c-Jun and a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The results suggest a proapoptotic activity for the active SSRIs accompanied by mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade activation and Bcl-2 inhibition. In vivo, we used CD1 nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with HT29 cells. On day 8, after cell inoculation sertraline or paroxetine (15 mg/kg x3/week i.p.) were administered to animals (6/group), which were monitored weekly (for 5 weeks) for tumor volume and body weight. At 5 weeks, the animals survived, with no significant difference in body weight. Sertraline, though not paroxetine, significantly inhibited tumor growth. Collectively, our results suggest that the widely-used antidepressant, sertraline, possesses a potential anti-tumor activity, which circumvents the MDR mechanism. Since SSRI therapy is frequently indicated in cancer patients, the use of sertraline in colon cancer patients with co-morbidity of depression seems attractive.},

abstract = {Current cancer research strongly focuses on identifying novel pathways that can be selectively exploited in the clinic and identifying drugs capable of exploiting cancer vulnerabilities. Occasionally, drugs identified to exploit a cancer-specific vulnerability are on the market for clinical indications in another disease area. Rebranding them as anti-cancer drugs is a process commonly referred to as drug repurposing and is typically a faster method than bringing a novel drug to market. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are primarily used for treating several types of depression, but over the past two decades mounting evidence suggests that drugs in this class have oncolytic properties and reduce the risk of certain cancers. In the current work, we discuss how the secondary mechanisms of action associated with these drugs mediate their oncolytic effect. In particular, sertraline limits tumor growth by abrogating the PI3K/akt signaling pathway, a growth pathway shown to be constitutively active in multiple cancers. Fluoxetine has been shown to activate the AMPA-type glutamate receptor, induce massive calcium influx and mitochondrial calcium overload and induce caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. This receptor being highly overexpressed in cancer stem cells may explain why SSRIs lower the risk of multiple types of cancer. Fluoxetine has also been shown to inhibit multidrug resistance pumps, increasing the efficacy of several standard chemotherapies. Given the vast potential of SSRIs in treating cancer, these drugs should be more heavily used not only in treating cancer-related depression, but in combating cancer and increasing the efficacy of standard of care chemotherapies.},

Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.},

AggE accurately identified chemicals with significant morphological effects, including single-endpoint effects and multi-endpoint responses that would have been missed by univariate methods, while avoiding putative false-positives that confound traditional methods due to irregular correlation structure.

However, bottlenecks in imaging and image processing often make it difficult to differentiate interesting biological behavior from technical artifact. Thus there is a need for new methods that improve data quality without sacrificing throughput. Here we present a 3-step workflow to improve dynamic phenotype measurements of heterogeneous cell populations. We provide guidelines for image acquisition, phenotype tracking, and data filtering to remove erroneous cell tracks using the novel Tracking Aberration Measure (TrAM). Our workflow is broadly applicable across imaging platforms and analysis software. By applying this workflow to cancer cell assays, we reduced aberrant cell track prevalence from 17{\%} to 2{\%}. The cost of this improvement was removing 15{\%} of the well-tracked cells. This enabled detection of significant motility differences between cell lines. Similarly, we avoided detecting a false change in translocation kinetics by eliminating the true cause: varied proportions of unresponsive cells. Finally, by systematically seeking heterogeneous behaviors, we detected subpopulations that otherwise could have been missed, including early apoptotic events and pre-mitotic cells. We provide optimized protocols for specific applications and step-by-step guidelines for adapting them to a variety of biological systems.},

abstract = {Single cells respond heterogeneously to biochemical treatments, which can complicate the analysis of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In particular, stressful perturbations may induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a transformation through which compact, sensitive cells adopt an elongated, resistant phenotype. However, classical biochemical measurements based on population averages over large numbers cannot resolve single cell heterogeneity and plasticity. Here, we use high content imaging of single cell morphology to classify distinct phenotypic subpopulations after EMT. We first characterize a well-defined EMT induction through the master regulator Snail in mammary epithelial cells over 72 h. We find that EMT is associated with increased vimentin area as well as elongation of the nucleus and cytoplasm. These morphological features were integrated into a Gaussian mixture model that classified epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes with {\textgreater}92{\%} accuracy. We then applied this analysis to heterogeneous populations generated from less controlled EMT-inducing stimuli, including growth factors (TGF-$\beta$1), cell density, and chemotherapeutics (Taxol). Our quantitative, single cell approach has the potential to screen large heterogeneous cell populations for many types of phenotypic variability, and may thus provide a predictive assay for the preclinical assessment of targeted therapeutics.},

abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical and microbial strain collections is an indispensable tool for modern chemical and systems biology; however, HTS data sets have inherent systematic and random error, which may lead to false-positive or false-negative results. Several methods of normalization of data exist; nevertheless, due to the limitations of each, no single method has been universally adopted. Here, we present a method of data visualization and normalization that is effective, intuitive, and easy to implement in a spreadsheet program. For each plate, the data are ordered by ascending values and a plot thereof yields a curve that is a signature of the plate data. Curve shape characteristics provide intuitive visualization of the frequency and strength of inhibitors, activators, and noise on the plate, allowing potentially problematic plates to be flagged. To reduce plate-to-plate variation, the data can be normalized by the mean of the middle 50{\%} of ordered values, also called the interquartile mean (IQM) or the 50{\%} trimmed mean of the plate. Positional effects due to bias in columns, rows, or wells can be corrected using the interquartile mean of each well position across all plates (IQMW) as a second level of normalization. We illustrate the utility of this method using data sets from biochemical and phenotypic screens.},

abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) has achieved a dominant role in drug discovery over the past 2 decades. The goal of HTS is to identify active compounds (hits) by screening large numbers of diverse chemical compounds against selected targets and/or cellular phenotypes. The HTS process consists of multiple automated steps involving compound handling, liquid transfers, and assay signal capture, all of which unavoidably contribute to systematic variation in the screening data. The challenge is to distinguish biologically active compounds from assay variability. Traditional plate controls-based and non-controls-based statistical methods have been widely used for HTS data processing and active identification by both the pharmaceutical industry and academic sectors. More recently, improved robust statistical methods have been introduced, reducing the impact of systematic row/column effects in HTS data. To apply such robust methods effectively and properly, we need to understand their necessity and functionality. Data from 6 HTS case histories are presented to illustrate that robust statistical methods may sometimes be misleading and can result in more, rather than less, false positives or false negatives. In practice, no single method is the best hit detection method for every HTS data set. However, to aid the selection of the most appropriate HTS data-processing and active identification methods, the authors developed a 3-step statistical decision methodology. Step 1 is to determine the most appropriate HTS data-processing method and establish criteria for quality control review and active identification from 3-day assay signal window and DMSO validation tests. Step 2 is to perform a multilevel statistical and graphical review of the screening data to exclude data that fall outside the quality control criteria. Step 3 is to apply the established active criterion to the quality-assured data to identify the active compounds.},

@article{Dragiev2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput screening (HTS) is a key part of the drug discovery process during which thousands of chemical compounds are screened and their activity levels measured in order to identify potential drug candidates (i.e., hits). Many technical, procedural or environmental factors can cause systematic measurement error or inequalities in the conditions in which the measurements are taken. Such systematic error has the potential to critically affect the hit selection process. Several error correction methods and software have been developed to address this issue in the context of experimental HTS 1234567. Despite their power to reduce the impact of systematic error when applied to error perturbed datasets, those methods also have one disadvantage - they introduce a bias when applied to data not containing any systematic error 6. Hence, we need first to assess the presence of systematic error in a given HTS assay and then carry out systematic error correction method if and only if the presence of systematic error has been confirmed by statistical tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We tested three statistical procedures to assess the presence of systematic error in experimental HTS data, including the $\chi$2 goodness-of-fit test, Student's t-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 8 preceded by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method 9. We applied these procedures to raw HTS measurements, first, and to estimated hit distribution surfaces, second. The three competing tests were applied to analyse simulated datasets containing different types of systematic error, and to a real HTS dataset. Their accuracy was compared under various error conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A successful assessment of the presence of systematic error in experimental HTS assays is possible when the appropriate statistical methodology is used. Namely, the t-test should be carried out by researchers to determine whether systematic error is present in their HTS data prior to applying any error correction method. This important step can significantly improve the quality of selected hits.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in biomedical sciences and genetics have increased the pressure on drug development companies to promptly translate new knowledge into treatments for disease. Impelled by the demand and facilitated by technological progress, the number of compounds evaluated during the initial high-throughput screening (HTS) step of drug discovery process has steadily increased. As a highly automated large-scale process, HTS is prone to systematic error caused by various technological and environmental factors. A number of error correction methods have been designed to reduce the effect of systematic error in experimental HTS (Brideau et al., 2003; Carralot et al., 2012; Kevorkov and Makarenkov, 2005; Makarenkov et al., 2007; Malo et al., 2010). Despite their power to correct systematic error when it is present, the applicability of those methods in practice is limited by the fact that they can potentially introduce a bias when applied to unbiased data. We describe two new methods for eliminating systematic error from HTS data based on a prior knowledge of the error location. This information can be obtained using a specific version of the t-test or of the $\chi$(2) goodness-of-fit test as discussed in Dragiev et al. (2011). We will show that both new methods constitute an important improvement over the standard practice of not correcting for systematic error at all as well as over the B-score correction procedure (Brideau et al., 2003) which is widely used in the modern HTS. We will also suggest a more general data preprocessing framework where the new methods can be applied in combination with the Well Correction procedure (Makarenkov et al., 2007). Such a framework will allow for removing systematic biases affecting all plates of a given screen as well as those relative to some of its individual plates.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most data analysis tools for high-throughput screening (HTS) seek to uncover interesting hits for further analysis. They typically assume a low hit rate per plate. Hit rates can be dramatically higher in secondary screening, RNAi screening and in drug sensitivity testing using biologically active drugs. In particular, drug sensitivity testing on primary cells is often based on dose-response experiments, which pose a more stringent requirement for data quality and for intra- and inter-plate variation. Here, we compared common plate normalization and noise-reduction methods, including the B-score and the Loess a local polynomial fit method under high hit-rate scenarios of drug sensitivity testing. We generated simulated 384-well plate HTS datasets, each with 71 plates having a range of 20 (5{\%}) to 160 (42{\%}) hits per plate, with controls placed either at the edge of the plates or in a scattered configuration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 20{\%} (77/384) as the critical hit-rate after which the normalizations started to perform poorly. Results from real drug testing experiments supported this estimation. In particular, the B-score resulted in incorrect normalization of high hit-rate plates, leading to poor data quality, which could be attributed to its dependency on the median polish algorithm. We conclude that a combination of a scattered layout of controls per plate and normalization using a polynomial least squares fit method, such as Loess helps to reduce column, row and edge effects in HTS experiments with high hit-rates and is optimal for generating accurate dose-response curves.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: john.mpindi@helsinki.fiAvailability and implementation, Supplementary information: R code and Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We have previously identified elevated PARP1 levels in SCLC and demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors AZD 2281 and AG014699. Here, we evaluate activity of a novel, potent PARP inhibitor, BMN 673, and identify markers of response as a basis for developing predictive markers for clinical application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Inhibition of SCLC proliferation by BMN 673 was assayed in vitro and effects on tumor growth were measured in SCLC xenograft models. Protein expression and pathway activation was assessed by reverse phase protein array and western blot analysis. PARP inhibition was confirmed using a PAR ELISA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate striking, single agent activity of BMN 673 in SCLC cell lines and xenografts, with single agent BMN 673 exhibiting in vivo activity similar to cisplatin. Sensitivity to BMN 673 was associated with elevated baseline expression levels of several DNA repair proteins, whereas greater drug resistance was observed in SCLC models with baseline activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, we developed and confirmed these data with a novel "DNA repair score" consisting of a group of 17 DNA repair proteins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated expression of multiple DNA repair proteins, as well as a corresponding "DNA repair protein score," predict response to BMN 673 in in vitro SCLC models. These observations complement recent work in which PI3K inhibition sensitizes breast cancer models to PARP inhibition, suggesting cooperation between DNA repair and PI3K pathways.},

abstract = {Since the advent of high-throughput screening (HTS), there has been an urgent need for methods that facilitate the interrogation of large-scale chemical biology data to build a mode of action (MoA) hypothesis. This can be done either prior to the HTS by subset design of compounds with known MoA or post HTS by data annotation and mining. To enable this process, we developed a tool that compares compounds solely on the basis of their bioactivity: the chemical biological descriptor “high-throughput screening fingerprint” (HTS-FP). In the current embodiment, data are aggregated from 195 biochemical and cell-based assays developed at Novartis and can be used to identify bioactivity relationships among the in-house collection comprising ∼1.5 million compounds. We demonstrate the value of the HTS-FP for virtual screening and in particular scaffold hopping. HTS-FP outperforms state of the art methods in several aspects, retrieving bioactive compounds with remarkable chemical dissimilarity to a probe structure. We also apply HTS-FP for the design of screening subsets in HTS. Using retrospective data, we show that a biodiverse selection of plates performs significantly better than a chemically diverse selection of plates, both in terms of number of hits and diversity of chemotypes retrieved. This is also true in the case of hit expansion predictions using HTS-FP similarity. Sets of compounds clustered with HTS-FP are biologically meaningful, in the sense that these clusters enrich for genes and gene ontology (GO) terms, showing that compounds that are bioactively similar also tend to target proteins that operate together in the cell. HTS-FP are valuable not only because of their predictive power but mainly because they relate compounds solely on the basis of bioactivity, harnessing the accumulated knowledge of a high-throughput screening facility toward the understanding of how compounds interact with the proteome.},

abstract = {Predicting the cellular response of compounds is a challenge central to the discovery of new drugs. Compound biological signatures have risen as a way of representing the perturbation produced by a compound in the cell. However, their ability to encode specific phenotypic information and generating tangible predictions remains unknown, mainly because of the inherent noise in such data sets. In this work, we statistically aggregate signals from several compound biological signatures to find compounds that produce a desired phenotype in the cell. We exploit this method in two applications relevant for phenotypic screening in drug discovery programs: target-independent hit expansion and target identification. As a result, we present here (i) novel nanomolar inhibitors of cellular division that reproduce the phenotype and the mode of action of reference natural products and (ii) blockers of the NKCC1 cotransporter for autism spectrum disorders.

EGFR subtype identification plays a crucial role in deciding the drug combination to treat the cancer patients. Conventional application of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) produces more discordance results in EGFR subtype identification of cancer specimens. The present study is designed to develop an analytical method for simultaneous identification of cell surface biomarkers and quantitative estimation of drug efficacy in cancer specimens. For this study, we have utilized a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM), Qdot molecular probes and chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin (CPT)-treated breast cancer cell lines namely MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and JIMT-1. Highly sensitive detection signals with low background noise generated from the evanescent field excitation of TIRFM make it a highly suitable tool to detect the cell surface biomarkers in living cells. Moreover, single wavelength excitation of Qdot probes offers multicolour imaging with strong emission brightness. In the present study, TIRF high-content imaging system simultaneously showed the expression pattern of EGFRs and EC50 value for CPT-induced apoptosis and necrosis in MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and JIMT-1 cancer cell lines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated classification using machine learning often relies on features derived from segmenting individual objects, which can be difficult to automate. WND-CHARM is a previously developed classification algorithm in which features are computed on the whole image, thereby avoiding the need for segmentation. The algorithm obtained encouraging results but requires considerable computational expertise to execute. Furthermore, some benchmark sets have been shown to be subject to confounding artifacts that overestimate classification accuracy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed CP-CHARM, a user-friendly image-based classification algorithm inspired by WND-CHARM in (i) its ability to capture a wide variety of morphological aspects of the image, and (ii) the absence of requirement for segmentation. In order to make such an image-based classification method easily accessible to the biological research community, CP-CHARM relies on the widely-used open-source image analysis software CellProfiler for feature extraction. To validate our method, we reproduced WND-CHARM's results and ensured that CP-CHARM obtained comparable performance. We then successfully applied our approach on cell-based assay data and on tissue images. We designed these new training and test sets to reduce the effect of batch-related artifacts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed method preserves the strengths of WND-CHARM - it extracts a wide variety of morphological features directly on whole images thereby avoiding the need for cell segmentation, but additionally, it makes the methods easily accessible for researchers without computational expertise by implementing them as a CellProfiler pipeline. It has been demonstrated to perform well on a wide range of bioimage classification problems, including on new datasets that have been carefully selected and annotated to minimize batch effects. This provides for the first time a realistic and reliable assessment of the whole image classification strategy.},

abstract = {Phenotypic screening through high-content automated microscopy is a powerful tool for evaluating the mechanism of action of candidate therapeutics. Despite more than a decade of development, however, high content assays have yielded mixed results, identifying robust phenotypes in only a small subset of compound classes. This has led to a combinatorial explosion of assay techniques, analyzing cellular phenotypes across dozens of assays with hundreds of measurements. Here, using a minimalist three-stain assay and only 23 basic cellular measurements, we developed an analytical approach that leverages informative dimensions extracted by linear discriminant analysis to evaluate similarity between the phenotypic trajectories of different compounds in response to a range of doses. This method enabled us to visualize biologically-interpretable phenotypic tracks populated by compounds of similar mechanism of action, cluster compounds according to phenotypic similarity, and classify novel compounds by comparing them to phenotypically active exemplars. Hierarchical clustering applied to 154 compounds from over a dozen different mechanistic classes demonstrated tight agreement with published compound mechanism classification. Using 11 phenotypically active mechanism classes, classification was performed on all 154 compounds: 78{\%} were correctly identified as belonging to one of the 11 exemplar classes or to a different unspecified class, with accuracy increasing to 89{\%} when less phenotypically active compounds were excluded. Importantly, several apparent clustering and classification failures, including rigosertib and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, instead revealed more complex mechanisms or off-target effects verified by more recent publications. These results show that a simple, easily replicated, minimalist high-content assay can reveal subtle variations in the cellular phenotype induced by compounds and can correctly predict mechanism of action, as long as the appropriate analytical tools are used.},

The effects of statistical gene–gene interactions on phenotypes have been used to assign genes to functional modules. However, directional, epistatic interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, have been challenging to map at large-scale. Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis. Moreover, it revealed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that we show is conserved in human cancer cells. Our study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations.},

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how different CNN methods compare with each other and with previous state-of-the-art shallow representations such as the Bag-of-Visual-Words and the Improved Fisher Vector. This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost.

Co-cultures are often required for cell survival or proliferation, or to maintain physiological functioning in vitro. Having two cell types co-exist in culture, however, poses several challenges, including difficulties distinguishing the two populations during analysis using automated image analysis algorithms. We previously analyzed co-cultured primary human hepatocytes and mouse fibroblasts in a high-throughput image-based chemical screen, using a combination of segmentation, measurement, and subsequent machine learning to score each cell as hepatocyte or fibroblast. While this approach was successful in counting hepatocytes for primary screening, segmentation of the fibroblast nuclei was less accurate. Here, we present an improved approach that more accurately identifies both cell types. Pixel-based machine learning (using the software ilastik) is used to seed segmentation of each cell type individually (using the software CellProfiler). This streamlined and accurate workflow can be carried out using freely available and open source software.},

abstract = {In primary fibroblasts from Leigh Syndrome (LS) patients, isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency is associated with increased reactive oxygen species levels and mitochondrial morpho-functional changes. Empirical evidence suggests these aberrations constitute linked therapeutic targets for small chemical molecules. However, the latter generally induce multiple subtle effects, meaning that in vitro potency analysis or single-parameter high-throughput cell screening are of limited use to identify these molecules. We combine automated image quantification and artificial intelligence to discriminate between primary fibroblasts of a healthy individual and a LS patient based upon their mitochondrial morpho-functional phenotype. We then evaluate the effects of newly developed Trolox variants in LS patient cells. This revealed that Trolox ornithylamide hydrochloride best counterbalanced mitochondrial morpho-functional aberrations, effectively scavenged ROS and increased the maximal activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and citrate synthase. Our results suggest that Trolox-derived antioxidants are promising candidates in therapy development for human mitochondrial disorders.},

abstract = {Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disorder of the $\beta$-globin gene. SCA results in chronic ischemia with pain and tissue injury. The extent of SCA symptoms can be ameliorated by treatment with drugs, which result in increasing the levels of $\gamma$-globin in patient red blood cells. Hydroxyurea (HU) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for SCA, but it has dose-limiting toxicity, and patients exhibit highly variable treatment responses. To identify compounds that may lead to the development of better and safer medicines, we have established a method using primary human bone marrow day 7 erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) to screen for compounds that induce $\gamma$-globin production. First, human marrow CD34(+) cells were cultured and expanded for 7 days and characterized for the expression of erythroid differentiation markers (CD71, CD36, and CD235a). Second, fresh or cryopreserved EPCs were treated with compounds for 3 days in 384-well plates followed by $\gamma$-globin quantification by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was validated using HU and decitabine. From the 7408 compounds screened, we identified at least one new compound with confirmed $\gamma$-globin-inducing activity. Hits are undergoing analysis in secondary assays. In this article, we describe the method of generating fit-for-purpose EPCs; the development, optimization, and validation of the ELISA and secondary assays for $\gamma$-globin detection; and screening results.},

SaLSSA analysis of 13,983 unique compounds uncovered that {\textgreater}90{\%} of well-characterized antimalarials, including endoperoxides and 4-aminoquinolines, as well as compounds active against asexual blood stages, lost most of their killing activity when parasites developed into metabolically quiescent stage V gametocytes. On the other hand, we identified compounds with consistent low nanomolar transmission-blocking activity, some of which showed cross-reactivity against asexual blood and liver stages. The data clearly emphasize substantial physiological differences between sexual and asexual parasites and provide a tool and starting points for the discovery and development of transmission-blocking drugs.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes seasonal epidemics of contagious respiratory illness that causes substantial morbidity and some mortality. Regular vaccination is the principal strategy for controlling influenza virus, although vaccine efficacy is variable. IAV antiviral drugs are available; however, substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently FDA-approved antiviral drugs. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are being sought to reduce the burden of influenza-related disease. A high-throughput screen using a human kinase inhibitor library was performed targeting an emerging IAV strain (H7N9) in A549 cells. The inhibitor library contained 273 structurally diverse, active cell permeable kinase inhibitors with known bioactivity and safety profiles, many of which are at advanced stages of clinical development. The current study shows that treatment of human A549 cells with kinase inhibitors dinaciclib, flavopiridol, or PIK-75 exhibits potent antiviral activity against H7N9 IAV as well as other IAV strains. Thus, targeting host kinases can provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach against IAV. These findings provide a path forward for repurposing existing kinase inhibitors safely as potential antivirals, particularly those that can be tested in vivo and ultimately for clinical use.},

abstract = {The use of patient-specific data in drug and dose selection is becoming an increasingly important component in cancer therapy. Basing drug choice on molecular aspects of the tumor is consistent with the identification of cancer as a molecular disease or dis- eases, even within the same histological type, and its treatment specific to the background fromwhich it arose and exists. Multiple examples exist of single-gene mutations, and over- or under- expression that convey either sensitivity or resistance to a given agent. What about the picture that global gene expression in a cancer presents regarding drug sensitivity or resistance? Coex- pression extrapolation (COXEN) is a methodology that acts as a Rosetta stone between patterns of gene expression that correlate to drug responses in vitro and those in tumors of untreated patients to predict chemosensitivity in such tumors even to drugs that are not specifically indicated for that histotype. Further applications of COXEN in drug discovery allow for in silico screens correlating drug response and gene expression in a genetically diverse cell panel to gene expression patterns in a target tumor with the potential for identifying and repurposing compounds. Here we discuss how COXEN is being developed and tested for application in drug se- lection, repositioning, and repurposing in oncology.},

abstract = {The expanding "valley of death" in drug development is leaving potentially life-saving new chemical entities and molecular targets fallow. This situation is forcing early-stage companies to think creatively about moving their technologies forward, especially as institutional investors show more interest in later stages of development. Drug repurposing, a strategy to examine existing drugs for therapeutic value against different diseases, is an emerging method to bring an off-market drug back onto the market. Tau Therapeutics LLC identified the role of T-type calcium channel blockers (Cav3) in cancer proliferation, but the company was unable to attract funding while having both a nonvalidated drug target and new chemical entities. To change the risk profile of the company, Tau set out to repurpose the known Cav3 drug mibefradil as a proof of concept for the treatment of cancer. Mibefradil was launched for hypertension in the 1990s but withdrawn because of drug-drug interactions. A new sequential combination treatment, termed Interlaced Therapy™, uses short-term administration of mibefradil to enhance the overall therapeutic potential of conventional anticancer agents. Mibefradil is currently in a phase Ib clinical trial with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Adult Brain Tumor Consortium. Mibefradil has been repurposed from an abandoned antihypertensive to a targeted solid tumor treatment, and it has been rescued from drug-drug interactions by using short-term dose exposure. Tau is using the early success of mibefradil as a proof of concept to build a platform technology of Cav3 blockers for broad antitumor applications in combination with new targeted cancer therapies, well-established chemotherapies, and radiation.},

In this study, we describe a phenotypic antibody screen using three-dimensional cultures of primary cells, and image-based multi-parametric profiling in PC-3 cells, to identify anti-cancer biologics against new therapeutic targets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: ScFv Antibodies and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) were isolated using phage display selections against primary non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. The selected molecules were screened for anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity against primary cells grown in three-dimensional culture, and in an ultra-high content screen on a 3-D cultured cell line using multi-parametric profiling to detect treatment-induced phenotypic changes. The targets of molecules of interest were identified using a cell-surface membrane protein array. An anti-CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) antibody was tested for tumour growth inhibition in a patient-derived xenograft model, generated from a stage-IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, with and without cisplatin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Two primary non-small cell lung carcinoma cell models were established for antibody isolation and primary screening in anti-proliferative and apoptosis assays. These assays identified multiple antibodies demonstrating activity in specific culture formats. A subset of the DARPins was profiled in an ultra-high content multi-parametric screen, where 300 morphological features were measured per sample. Machine learning was used to select features to classify treatment responses, then antibodies were characterised based on the phenotypes that they induced. This method co-classified several DARPins that targeted CDCP1 into two sets with different phenotypes. Finally, an anti-CDCP1 antibody significantly enhanced the efficacy of cisplatin in a patient-derived NSCLC xenograft model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic profiling using complex 3-D cell cultures steers hit selection towards more relevant in vivo phenotypes, and may shed light on subtle mechanistic variations in drug candidates, enabling data-driven decisions for oncology target validation. CDCP1 was identified as a potential target for cisplatin combination therapy.},

Here, we have developed a new image analysis platform to automatically profile 3D cell phenotypes with 598 parameters including morphology, topology, and texture parameters such as wavelet and image moments. As proof of concept, we analyzed mouse breast cancer cells (4T1 cells) in a 384-well plate format following exposure to a diverse set of compounds at different concentrations. The result showed concentration dependent phenotypic trajectories for different biologically active compounds that could be used to classify compounds based on their biological target. To demonstrate the wider applicability of our method, we analyzed the phenotypes of a collection of 44 human breast cancer cell lines cultured in 3D and showed that our method correctly distinguished basal-A, basal-B, luminal and ERBB2+ cell lines in a supervised nearest neighbor classification method.},

The question of how to build and evolve efficient screening collections systematically for cell-based and biochemical screening is still unresolved. It is often assumed that chemical structure diversity leads to diverse biological performance of a library. Here, we confirm earlier results showing that this inference is not always valid and suggest instead using biological measurement diversity derived from multiplexed profiling in the construction of libraries with diverse assay performance patterns for cell-based screens. Rather than using results from tens or hundreds of completed assays, which is resource intensive and not easily extensible, we use high-dimensional image-based cell morphology and gene expression profiles. We piloted this approach using over 30,000 compounds. We show that small-molecule profiling can be used to select compound sets with high rates of activity and diverse biological performance.},

These activity patterns are being used in conjunction with molecular structural features of the tested agents to explore the NCI's database of more than 460,000 compounds, and they are providing insight into potential target molecules and modulators of activity in the 60 cell lines. For example, the information is being used to search for candidate anticancer drugs that are not dependent on intact p53 suppressor gene function for their activity. It remains to be seen how effective this information-intensive strategy will be at generating new clinically active agents.},

So far, many high-content approaches, using sophisticated imaging technology and bioinformatics, have been developed. In our study, we aimed to develop a simpler method that focuses on intact cell images because we found that dynamic changes in morphology are informative, often reflecting the mechanism of action of a drug. Here, we constructed a chemical-genetic phenotype profiling system, based on the high-content cell morphology database Morphobase. This database compiles the phenotypes of cancer cell lines that are induced by hundreds of reference compounds, wherein those of well-characterized anticancer drugs are classified by mode of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this system in identifying NPD6689, NPD8617, and NPD8969 as tubulin inhibitors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Discovering small-molecule modulators for thousands of gene products requires multiple stages of biological testing, specificity evaluation, and chemical optimization. Many cellular profiling methods, including cellular sensitivity, gene expression, and cellular imaging, have emerged as methods to assess the functional consequences of biological perturbations. Cellular profiling methods applied to small-molecule science provide opportunities to use complex phenotypic information to prioritize and optimize small-molecule structures simultaneously against multiple biological endpoints. As throughput increases and cost decreases for such technologies, we see an emerging paradigm of using more information earlier in probe-discovery and drug-discovery efforts. Moreover, increasing access to public datasets makes possible the construction of 'virtual' profiles of small-molecule performance, even when multiplexed measurements were not performed or when multidimensional profiling was not the original intent. We review some key conceptual advances in small-molecule phenotypic profiling, emphasizing connections to other information, such as protein-binding measurements, genetic perturbations, and cell states. We argue that to maximally leverage these measurements in probe-discovery and drug-discovery requires a fundamental connection to synthetic chemistry, allowing the consequences of synthetic decisions to be described in terms of changes in small-molecule profiles. Mining such data in the context of chemical structure and synthesis strategies can inform decisions about chemistry procurement and library development, leading to optimal small-molecule screening collections. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasingly, multiplexed small-molecule profiling assays allow simultaneous measurement of many biological response parameters for the same compound (e.g., expression levels for many genes or binding constants against many proteins). Although such methods promise to capture SARs with high granularity, few computational methods are available to support SAR analyses of high-dimensional compound activity profiles. Many of these methods are not generally applicable or reduce the activity space to scalar summary statistics before establishing SARs. In this article, we present a versatile computational method that automatically extracts interpretable SAR rules from high-dimensional profiling data. The rules connect chemical structural features of compounds to patterns in their biological activity profiles. We applied our method to data from novel cell-based gene-expression and imaging assays collected on more than 30,000 small molecules. Based on the rules identified for this data set, we prioritized groups of compounds for further study, including a novel set of putative histone deacetylase inhibitors.},

ES cells differentiate into different lineages by successively making use of different subsets of the genome's possible macromolecular interactions. If a compound effectively targets just one of these interactions, it derails the developmental pathway to produce a phenotypical change. The OTRADI microsource spectrum library of 2000 approved drug components, natural products, and bioactive components was screened for compounds that can induce phenotypic changes in ES cell cultures at 10 µM after 3 days. Twenty-one compounds that induced specific morphologies also induced unique changes to an expression profile of a dozen markers of early embryonic development, indicating that each compound has derailed the molecular developmental process in a characteristic way. Phenotypic screens conducted with ES cultures differentiating along different lineages can be used to efficiently prescreen compounds able to regulate cell differentiation lineage.},

In this work, we are particularly interested in the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), a cutting-edge machine learning method, to the classification of compounds in chemical mechanisms of action (MOAs). Compound classification has been performed using image-based profiling methods sometimes combined with feature reduction methods such as principal component analysis or factor analysis. In this article, we map the input features of each cell to a particular MOA class without using any treatment-level profiles or feature reduction methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of DNN in this domain, leveraging single-cell information. Furthermore, we use deep transfer learning (DTL) to alleviate the intensive and computational demanding effort of searching the huge parameter's space of a DNN. Results show that using this approach, we obtain a 30{\%} speedup and a 2{\%} accuracy improvement.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR chloride channel. Deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del), the most frequent CF mutation, impairs the maturation and gating of the CFTR protein. Such defects may be corrected in vitro by pharmacological modulators named as correctors and potentiators, respectively. We have evaluated a panel of correctors and potentiators derived from various sources to assess potency, efficacy, and mechanism of action. For this purpose, we have used functional and biochemical assays on two different cell expression systems, Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) and A549 cells. The order of potency and efficacy of potentiators was similar in the two cell types considered, with phenylglycine PG-01 and isoxazole UCCF-152 being the most potent and least potent, respectively. Most potentiators were also effective on two mutations, G551D and G1349D, that cause a purely gating defect. In contrast, corrector effect was strongly affected by cell background, with the extreme case of many compounds working in one cell type only. Our findings are in favor of a direct action of potentiators on CFTR, possibly at a common binding site. In contrast, most correctors seem to work indirectly with various mechanisms of action. Combinations of correctors acting at different levels may lead to additive F508del-CFTR rescue.},

abstract = {Cellular populations have been widely observed to respond heterogeneously to perturbation. However, interpreting the observed heterogeneity is an extremely challenging problem because of the complexity of possible cellular phenotypes, the large dimension of potential perturbations, and the lack of methods for separating meaningful biological information from noise. Here, we develop an image-based approach to characterize cellular phenotypes based on patterns of signaling marker colocalization. Heterogeneous cellular populations are characterized as mixtures of phenotypically distinct subpopulations, and responses to perturbations are summarized succinctly as probabilistic redistributions of these mixtures. We apply our method to characterize the heterogeneous responses of cancer cells to a panel of drugs. We find that cells treated with drugs of (dis-)similar mechanism exhibit (dis-)similar patterns of heterogeneity. Despite the observed phenotypic diversity of cells observed within our data, low-complexity models of heterogeneity were sufficient to distinguish most classes of drug mechanism. Our approach offers a computational framework for assessing the complexity of cellular heterogeneity, investigating the degree to which perturbations induce redistributions of a limited, but nontrivial, repertoire of underlying states and revealing functional significance contained within distinct patterns of heterogeneous responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool for drug discovery. However, the discovery of drugs targeting neurons is still hampered by the inability to accurately identify and quantify the phenotypic changes of multiple neurons in a single image (named multi-neuron image) of a high-content screen. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an automated image analysis method for analyzing multi-neuron images.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose an automated analysis method with novel descriptors of neuromorphology features for analyzing HCS-based multi-neuron images, called HCS-neurons. To observe multiple phenotypic changes of neurons, we propose two kinds of descriptors which are neuron feature descriptor (NFD) of 13 neuromorphology features, e.g., neurite length, and generic feature descriptors (GFDs), e.g., Haralick texture. HCS-neurons can 1) automatically extract all quantitative phenotype features in both NFD and GFDs, 2) identify statistically significant phenotypic changes upon drug treatments using ANOVA and regression analysis, and 3) generate an accurate classifier to group neurons treated by different drug concentrations using support vector machine and an intelligent feature selection method. To evaluate HCS-neurons, we treated P19 neurons with nocodazole (a microtubule depolymerizing drug which has been shown to impair neurite development) at six concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 ng/mL. The experimental results show that all the 13 features of NFD have statistically significant difference with respect to changes in various levels of nocodazole drug concentrations (NDC) and the phenotypic changes of neurites were consistent to the known effect of nocodazole in promoting neurite retraction. Three identified features, total neurite length, average neurite length, and average neurite area were able to achieve an independent test accuracy of 90.28{\%} for the six-dosage classification problem. This NFD module and neuron image datasets are provided as a freely downloadable MatLab project at http://iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/HCS-Neurons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Few automatic methods focus on analyzing multi-neuron images collected from HCS used in drug discovery. We provided an automatic HCS-based method for generating accurate classifiers to classify neurons based on their phenotypic changes upon drug treatments. The proposed HCS-neurons method is helpful in identifying and classifying chemical or biological molecules that alter the morphology of a group of neurons in HCS.},

abstract = {Cell-based high content screening (HCS) is becoming an important and increasingly favored approach in therapeutic drug discovery and functional genomics. In HCS, changes in cellular morphology and biomarker distributions provide an information-rich profile of cellular responses to experimental treatments such as small molecules or gene knockdown probes. One obstacle that currently exists with such cell-based assays is the availability of image processing algorithms that are capable of reliably and automatically analyzing large HCS image sets. HCS images of primary neuronal cell cultures are particularly challenging to analyze due to complex cellular morphology. Here we present a robust method for quantifying and statistically analyzing the morphology of neuronal cells in HCS images. The major advantages of our method over existing software lie in its capability to correct non-uniform illumination using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization method; segment neuromeres using Gabor-wavelet texture analysis; and detect faint neurites by a novel phase-based neurite extraction algorithm that is invariant to changes in illumination and contrast and can accurately localize neurites. Our method was successfully applied to analyze a large HCS image set generated in a morphology screen for polyglutamine-mediated neuronal toxicity using primary neuronal cell cultures derived from embryos of a Drosophila Huntington's Disease (HD) model.},

abstract = {An imaged-based profiling and analysis system was developed to predict clinically effective synergistic drug combinations that could accelerate the identification of effective multi-drug therapies for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and other challenging malignancies. The identification of effective drug combinations for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was achieved by integrating high-content screening, computational analysis, and experimental biology. The approach was based on altered cellular phenotypes induced by 55 FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds, acquired using fluorescence microscopy and retained in multivariate compound profiles. Dissimilarities between compound profiles guided the identification of 5 combinations, which were assessed for qualitative interaction on TNBC cell growth. The combination of the microtubule-targeting drug vinblastine with KSP/Eg5 motor protein inhibitors monastrol or ispinesib showed potent synergism in 3 independent TNBC cell lines, which was not substantiated in normal fibroblasts. The synergistic interaction was mediated by an increase in mitotic arrest with cells demonstrating typical ispinesib-induced monopolar mitotic spindles, which translated into enhanced apoptosis induction. The antitumour activity of the combination vinblastine/ispinesib was confirmed in an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC. Compared to single drug treatment, combination treatment significantly reduced tumour growth without causing increased toxicity. Image-based profiling and analysis led to the rapid discovery of a drug combination effective against TNBC invitro and invivo, and has the potential to lead to the development of new therapeutic options in other hard-to-treat cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exposure of human neutrophils to uniform concentrations of chemoattractants, such as N-formyl peptides, induces morphological cell polarization. In this study we report the temporal sequence of changes in cell shape, F-actin, and cell surface morphology during cellular polarization induced by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) in human neutrophils in suspension.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Neutrophil shape changes induced by 10(-8) M fMLP were observed with DIC microscopy. Size and cellular granularity were analyzed by flow cytometry measuring their forward and side scattered light. To visualize F-actin distribution, neutrophils were labeled with the fluorescence probe FITC-phalloidin, and were examined with fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cell surface morphology was assessed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The stimulation of round-smooth neutrophils with nanomolar concentrations (10(-8) M) of fMLP in suspension induced a temporal sequence of morphological changes during cell polarization, characterized by 1) increase in size as determined by forward angle scattered light, 2) rapid redistribution of F-actin from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization to the cell periphery, and 3) rapid reorganization of cell surface morphological features, with accumulation of plasma membrane in the front of polar cells. Four cell shapes were identified with SEM after stimulation of round-smooth neutrophils: round-ridged, round-ruffled, nonpolar ruffled, and polar cells. These cell shapes were correlated with a cortical localization, focal aggregates, and multipolar distribution of F-actin. In polar neutrophils, F-actin became concentrated in the front of the cell.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings show the relation between reorganization of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and modifications in cell shape and surface features during cell polarization induced after fMLP activation in neutrophils. This approach offers a powerful tool for further analysis of receptor distribution in polarized, motile neutrophils.},

The main goal of analysis in this paper is to provide automatic image processing approaches to process neuron images for studying neuron mechanism in high content screening. In the nuclei channel, all nuclei are segmented and detected by applying the gradient vector field based watershed. Then the neuronal nuclei are selected based on the soma region detected in neurite channel. In neurite images, we propose a novel neurite centerline extraction approach using the improved line-pixel detection technique. The proposed neurite tracing method can detect the curvilinear structure more accurately compared with the current existing methods. An interface called NeuriteIQ based on the proposed algorithms is developed finally for better application in high content screening. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Small molecules often affect multiple targets, elicit off‐target effects, and induce genotype‐specific responses. Chemical genetics, the mapping of the genotype dependence of a small molecule's effects across a broad spectrum of phenotypes can identify novel mechanisms of action. It can also reveal unanticipated effects and could thereby reduce high attrition rates of small molecule development pipelines. Here, we used high‐content screening and image analysis to measure effects of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds on complex phenotypes in isogenic cancer cell lines which harbor activating or inactivating mutations in key oncogenic signaling pathways. Using multiparametric chemical–genetic interaction analysis, we observed phenotypic gene–drug interactions for more than 193 compounds, with many affecting phenotypes other than cell growth. We created a resource termed the Pharmacogenetic Phenome Compendium (PGPC), which enables exploration of drug mode of action, detection of potential off‐target effects, and the generation of hypotheses on drug combinations and synergism. For example, we demonstrate that MEK inhibitors amplify the viability effect of the clinically used anti‐alcoholism drug disulfiram and show that the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG555 has off‐target activity on the proteasome. Taken together, this study demonstrates how combining multiparametric phenotyping in different genetic backgrounds can be used to predict additional mechanisms of action and to reposition clinically used drugs. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} This study defines a quantitative map of phenotypic pharmacogenetic interactions in human cancer cells using high‐content imaging screens in a panel of isogenic cell lines.

abstract = {Target-based high-throughput screening (HTS) has recently been critiqued for its relatively poor yield compared to phenotypic screening approaches. One type of phenotypic screening, image-based high-content screening (HCS), has been seen as particularly promising. In this article, we assess whether HCS is as high content as it can be. We analyze HCS publications and find that although the number of HCS experiments published each year continues to grow steadily, the information content lags behind. We find that a majority of high-content screens published so far (60-80{\%}) made use of only one or two image-based features measured from each sample and disregarded the distribution of those features among each cell population. We discuss several potential explanations, focusing on the hypothesis that data analysis traditions are to blame. This includes practical problems related to managing large and multidimensional HCS data sets as well as the adoption of assay quality statistics from HTS to HCS. Both may have led to the simplification or systematic rejection of assays carrying complex and valuable phenotypic information. We predict that advanced data analysis methods that enable full multiparametric data to be harvested for entire cell populations will enable HCS to finally reach its potential.},

abstract = {For effective bioactive small molecule discovery and development into new therapeutic drug, a systematic screening and target protein identification is required. Different from the conventional screening system, herein phenotypic screening in combination with multi-omics-based target identification and validation (MOTIV) is introduced. First, phenotypic screening provides visual effect of bioactive small molecules in the cell or organism level. It is important to know the effect on the cell or organism level since small molecules affect not only a single target but the entire cellular mechanism within a cell or organism. Secondly, MOTIV provides systemic approach to discover the target protein of bioactive small molecule. With the chemical genomics and proteomics approach of target identification methods, various target protein candidates are identified. Then network analysis and validations of these candidates result in identifying the biologically relevant target protein and cellular mechanism. Overall, the combination of phenotypic screening and MOTIV will provide an effective approach to discover new bioactive small molecules and their target protein and mechanism identification. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently, a phenotypic approach-screens that assess the effects of compounds on cells, tissues, or whole organisms-has been reconsidered and reintroduced as a complementary strategy of a target-based approach for drug discovery. Although the finding of novel bioactive compounds from large chemical libraries has become routine, the identification of their molecular targets is still a time-consuming and difficult process, making this step rate-limiting in drug development. In the last decade, we and other researchers have amassed a large amount of phenotypic data through progress in omics research and advances in instrumentation. Accordingly, the profiling methodologies using these datasets expertly have emerged to identify and validate specific molecular targets of drug candidates, attaining some progress in current drug discovery (e.g., eribulin). In the case of a compound that shows an unprecedented phenotype likely by inhibiting a first-in-class target, however, such phenotypic profiling is invalid. Under the circumstances, a photo-crosslinking affinity approach should be beneficial. In this review, we describe and summarize recent progress in both affinity-based (direct) and phenotypic profiling (indirect) approaches for chemical biology target identification.},

By combining a deformation-based method for measuring distances between two shape conﬁgurations together with multidimensional scaling, a method for determining the number of degrees of freedom in a shape distribution is described. In addition, a method for visu- alizing the most representative modes of variation (underlying shape parameterization) in a nuclei shape distribution is also presented. The novel approach takes into account the nonlinear nature of shape manifolds and is related to the ISOMAP algorithm. We apply the method to the task of analyzing the shape distribution of HeLa cell nuclei and conclude that approximately three parameters are respon- sible for their shape variation. Excluding differences in size, transla- tion, and orientation, these are: elongation, bending (concavity), and shifts in mass distribution. In addition, results show that, contrary to common intuition, the most likely nuclear shape conﬁguration is not symmetric.},

Traditionally, analysis of such images has been done manually. Manual annotation is, however, slow, expensive, and often highly variable from one expert to another. Furthermore, with modern automated microscopes, hundreds to thousands of images can be collected per hour, making manual analysis infeasible. This field borrows from the pattern recognition and computer vision literature (which contain many techniques for image processing and recognition), but has its own unique challenges and tradeoffs. Fluorescence microscopy images represent perhaps the largest class of biological images for which automation is needed. For this modality, typical problems include cell segmentation, classification of phenotypical response, or decisions regarding differentiated responses (treatment vs. control setting). This overview focuses on the problem of subcellular location determination as a running example, but the techniques discussed are often applicable to other problems.},

Three different light transducers are used in the system to exploit the best characteristics of these sensors for different biological measurements. A digital scanner, in the form of a linear array charge- coupled device (CCD), acquires data with high spatial and photometric resolution. A color (RGB) camera is employed when spectral information is required for the segmentation of cellular subcomponents. An image- intensified charged-injection device (CID) camera provides for very low light intensity measurements, primarily for fluorescence-labeled cells. Properties of these transducers, such as contrast transfer function, linearity, and photo-response nonuniformity, have been measured. Two dedicated image processing units were incorporated into the system. The front-end processor, based on a digital signal processor, provides functions such as object detection, raw image calibration, compression, artifact removal, and filtering. The second image processor is associated with the frame memory and includes a histogram processor, a dedicated arithmetic logic unit for image processing functions, and a graphics module for one-bit overlay functions. An interactive program was developed to acquire cell images and to experiment with a range of segmentation algorithms, feature extractions, and other image processing functions. The results of any image operation are displayed on the video monitor. Once a desired processing sequence is determined, the sequence may be stored to become part of a command library and can be executed thereafter as a single instruction.},

abstract = {The empirical characterization of nuclear shape distributions is an important unsolved problem with many applications in biology and medicine. Numerous genetic diseases and cancers have alterations in nuclear morphology, and methods for characterization of morphology could aid in both diagnoses and fundamental understanding of these disorders. Automated approaches have been used to measure features related to the size and shape of the cell nucleus, and statistical analysis of these features has often been performed assuming an underlying Euclidean (linear) vector space. We discuss the difficulties associated with the analysis of nuclear shape in light of the fact that shape spaces are nonlinear, and demonstrate methods for characterizing nuclear shapes and shape distributions based on spatial transformations that map one nucleus to another. By combining large deformation metric mapping with multidimensional scaling we offer a flexible approach for elucidating the intrinsic nonlinear degrees of freedom of a distribution of nuclear shapes. More specifically, we demonstrate approaches for nuclear shape interpolation and computation of mean nuclear shape. We also provide a method for estimating the number of free parameters that contribute to shape as well as an approach for visualizing most representative shape variations within a distribution of nuclei. The proposed methodology can be completely automated, is independent of the dimensionality of the images, and can handle complex shapes. Results obtained by analyzing two sets of images of HeLa cells are shown. In addition to identifying the modes of variation in normal HeLa nuclei, the effects of lamin A/C on nuclear morphology are quantitatively described.},

Images representing the localization patterns of 4 proteins and DNA were obtained using fluorescence microscopy and divided into distinct training and test sets.

These feature sets were used as inputs to either a classification tree or a neural network. Classifier performance (the average percent of each type of image correctly classified) on previously unseen images ranged from 63{\%} for a classification tree using Zernike moments to 88{\%} for a backpropagation neural network using a combination of features from the 2 feature sets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying pattern recognition methods to subcellular localization patterns, enabling sets of previously unseen images from a single class to be classified with an expected accuracy greater than 99{\%}.

abstract = {Cellular behavior is complex. Successfully understanding systems at ever-increasing complexity is fundamental to advances in modern science and unraveling the functional details of cellular behavior is no exception. We present a collection of prospectives to provide a glimpse of the techniques that will aid in collecting, managing and utilizing information on complex cellular processes via molecular imaging tools. These include: 1) visualizing intracellular protein activity with fluorescent markers, 2) high throughput (and automated) imaging of multilabeled cells in statistically significant numbers, and 3) machine intelligence to analyze subcellular image localization and pattern. Although not addressed here, the importance of combining cell-image-based information with detailed molecular structure and ligand-receptor binding models cannot be overlooked. Advanced molecular imaging techniques have the potential to impact cellular diagnostics for cancer screening, clinical correlations of tissue molecular patterns for cancer biology, and cellular molecular interactions for accelerating drug discovery. The goal of finally understanding all cellular components and behaviors will be achieved by advances in both instrumentation engineering (software and hardware) and molecular biochemistry.},

abstract = {Quantitative microscopy has proven a versatile and powerful phenotypic screening technique. Recently, image-based profiling has shown promise as a means for broadly characterizing molecules' effects on cells in several drug-discovery applications, including target-agnostic screening and predicting a compound's mechanism of action (MOA). Several profiling methods have been proposed, but little is known about their comparative performance, impeding the wider adoption and further development of image-based profiling. We compared these methods by applying them to a widely applicable assay of cultured cells and measuring the ability of each method to predict the MOA of a compendium of drugs. A very simple method that is based on population means performed as well as methods designed to take advantage of the measurements of individual cells. This is surprising because many treatments induced a heterogeneous phenotypic response across the cell population in each sample. Another simple method, which performs factor analysis on the cellular measurements before averaging them, provided substantial improvement and was able to predict MOA correctly for 94{\%} of the treatments in our ground-truth set. To facilitate the ready application and future development of image-based phenotypic profiling methods, we provide our complete ground-truth and test data sets, as well as open-source implementations of the various methods in a common software framework.},

Here, we have developed HIPMap, a high-precision, high-throughput, automated fluorescent in situ hybridization imaging pipeline, for mapping of the spatial location of genome regions at large scale. High-throughput imaging position mapping (HIPMap) enabled an unbiased siRNA screen for factors involved in genome organization in human cells. We identify 50 cellular factors required for proper positioning of a set of functionally diverse genomic loci. Positioning factors include chromatin remodelers, histone modifiers, and nuclear envelope and pore proteins. Components of the replication and post-replication chromatin re-assembly machinery are prominently represented among positioning factors, and timely progression of cells through replication, but not mitosis, is required for correct gene positioning. Our results establish a method for the large-scale mapping of genome locations and have led to the identification of a compendium of cellular factors involved in spatial genome organization.},

abstract = {Functional super-resolution (fSR) microscopy is based on the automated toponome imaging system (TIS). fSR-TIS provides insight into the myriad of different cellular functionalities by direct imaging of large subcellular protein networks in morphologically intact cells and tissues, referred to as the toponome. By cyclical fluorescence imaging of at least 100 molecular cell components, fSR-TIS overcomes the spectral limitations of fluorescence microscopy, which is the essential condition for the detection of protein network structures in situ/in vivo. The resulting data sets precisely discriminate between cell types, subcellular structures, cell states and diseases (fSR). With up to 16bits per protein, the power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) is at least 2100per subcellular data point. It provides the dimensionality necessary to uncover thousands of distinct protein clusters including their subcellular hierarchies controlling protein network topology and function in the one cell or tissue section. Here we review the technology and findings showing that functional protein networks of the cell surface in different cancers encompass the same hierarchical and spatial coding principle, but express cancer-specific toponome codes within that scheme (referred to as TIS codes). Findings suggest that TIS codes, extracted from large-scale toponome data, have the potential to be next-generation biomarkers because of their cell type and disease specificity. This is functionally substantiated by the observation that blocking toponome-specific lead proteins results in disassembly of molecular networks and loss of function. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we introduce a simple method that enables proteomic imaging for scalable, integrated, high-dimensional phenotyping of both animal tissues and human clinical samples. This method, termed SWITCH, uniformly secures tissue architecture, native biomolecules, and antigenicity across an entire system by synchronizing the tissue preservation reaction. The heat- and chemical-resistant nature of the resulting framework permits multiple rounds ({\textgreater}20) of relabeling. We have performed 22 rounds of labeling of a single tissue with precise co-registration of multiple datasets. Furthermore, SWITCH synchronizes labeling reactions to improve probe penetration depth and uniformity of staining. With SWITCH, we performed combinatorial protein expression profiling of the human cortex and also interrogated the geometric structure of the fiber pathways in mouse brains. Such integrated high-dimensional information may accelerate our understanding of biological systems at multiple levels.},

abstract = {Quantitative imaging has become a vital technique in biological discovery and clinical diagnostics; a plethora of tools have recently been developed to enable new and accelerated forms of biological investigation. Increasingly, the capacity for high-throughput experimentation provided by new imaging modalities, contrast techniques, microscopy tools, microfluidics and computer controlled systems shifts the experimental bottleneck from the level of physical manipulation and raw data collection to automated recognition and data processing. Yet, despite their broad importance, image analysis solutions to address these needs have been narrowly tailored. Here, we present a generalizable formulation for autonomous identification of specific biological structures that is applicable for many problems. The process flow architecture we present here utilizes standard image processing techniques and the multi-tiered application of classification models such as support vector machines (SVM). These low-level functions are readily available in a large array of image processing software packages and programming languages. Our framework is thus both easy to implement at the modular level and provides specific high-level architecture to guide the solution of more complicated image-processing problems. We demonstrate the utility of the classification routine by developing two specific classifiers as a toolset for automation and cell identification in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. To serve a common need for automated high-resolution imaging and behavior applications in the C. elegans research community, we contribute a ready-to-use classifier for the identification of the head of the animal under bright field imaging. Furthermore, we extend our framework to address the pervasive problem of cell-specific identification under fluorescent imaging, which is critical for biological investigation in multicellular organisms or tissues. Using these examples as a guide, we envision the broad utility of the framework for diverse problems across different length scales and imaging methods.},

abstract = {Rounded-amoeboid cancer cells use actomyosin contractility driven by Rho-ROCK and JAK-STAT3 to migrate efficiently. It has been suggested that rounded-amoeboid cancer cells do not require matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to invade. Here we compare MMP levels in rounded-amoeboid and elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cells. Surprisingly, we find that rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells secrete higher levels of several MMPs, including collagenase MMP-13 and gelatinase MMP-9. As a result, rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells degrade collagen I more efficiently than elongated-mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, using a non-catalytic mechanism, MMP-9 promotes rounded-amoeboid 3D migration through regulation of actomyosin contractility via CD44 receptor. MMP-9 is upregulated in a panel of rounded-amoeboid compared with elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cell lines and its levels are controlled by ROCK-JAK-STAT3 signalling. MMP-9 expression increases during melanoma progression and it is particularly prominent in the invasive fronts of lesions, correlating with cell roundness. Therefore, rounded-amoeboid cells use both catalytic and non-catalytic activities of MMPs for invasion.},

We then investigated the responses of human stem, cancer and immune cells to tissue ECM arrays originating from 11 different tissues. We validated the 2D and 3D arrays as representative of the in vivo microenvironment by means of quantitative analysis of tissue-specific cellular responses, including matrix production, adhesion and proliferation, and morphological changes after culture.

abstract = {Studies conducted at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) and in our laboratory show that databases including the drug sensitivities of panels of many human cancer cell lines provide valuable information on the molecular pharmacology of anticancer drugs. We established a panel of 39 cell lines of various human cancers and developed a database of their chemosensitivities. Drugs were profiled in terms of their "fingerprints", patterns of differential activity against the cell lines. There was a significant correlation between a drug's fingerprint and its mode of action, as observed in the NCI panel of 60 cell lines. Therefore our cell-line panel is a powerful tool to predict the modes of action of new compounds. We have been using this system for drug discovery, coupled with various target-based drug screenings. We used the system to identify a novel DNA minor-groove binder, MS-247, which has inhibitory activity against topoisomerases I and II, and potent in vivo antitumor activity against various human cancer xenografts. We also discovered a potent novel telomerase inhibitor, FJ5002, by mining our database with the COMPARE algorithm, followed by experimental validation. We investigated the gene expression profiles of the cell lines by using DNA microarrays to find profiles determining cellular chemosensitivity and new targets for anticancer drugs. Our integrated database, including the chemosensitivities and gene expression profiles of the cell-line panel, could provide a basis for drug discovery and personalized therapy.},

abstract = {Stem cell research has been progressing rapidly, contributing to regenerative biology and regenerative medicine. In this field, small-molecule compounds affecting stem cell proliferation/differentiation have been explored to understand stem cell biology and support regenerative medicine. In this study, we established a multiparametric screening system to detect bioactive compounds affecting the cell fate of human neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs), using human fetal hippocampal NSCs/NPCs, HIP-009 cells. We examined effects of 410 compounds, which were collected based on mechanisms of action (MOAs) and chemotypes, on HIP-009's cell fate (self-renewal, neuronal and astrocytic differentiation) and morphology by automated multiparametric assays and profiled induced cellular phenotypes. We found that this screening classified compounds with the same MOAs into subgroups according to additional pharmacological effects (e.g., mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 [mTORC1] inhibitors and mTORC1/mTORC2 dual...},

abstract = {Phenotypic screening monitors phenotypic changes induced by perturbations, including those generated by drugs or RNA interference. Currently-used methods for scoring screen hits have proven to be problematic, particularly when applied to physiologically relevant conditions such as low cell numbers or inefficient transfection. Here, we describe the $\Phi$-score, which is a novel scoring method for the identification of phenotypic modifiers or hits in cell-based screens. $\Phi$-score performance was assessed with simulations, a validation experiment and its application to gene identification in a large-scale RNAi screen. Using robust statistics and a variance model, we demonstrated that the $\Phi$-score showed better sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility compared to classical approaches. The improved performance of the $\Phi$-score paves the way for cell-based screening of primary cells, which are often difficult to obtain from patients in sufficient numbers. We also describe a dedicated merging procedure to pool scores from small interfering RNAs targeting the same gene so as to provide improved visualization and hit selection},

abstract = {This article reports label-free, real-time, and single-cell quantification of the invasion of spheroidal colon cancer cells through three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel using a resonant waveguide grating (RWG) imager. This imager employs a time-resolved swept wavelength interrogation scheme to monitor cell invasion and adhesion with a temporal resolution up to 3 s and a spatial resolution of 12 $\mu$m. As the model system, spheroids of human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells are generated by culturing the cells in 96-well round-bottom ultralow attachment plates. 3D Matrigel is formed by its gelation in 384-well RWG biosensor microplates. The invasion and adhesion of spheroidal HT29 cells is initiated by placing individual spheroids onto the Matrigel-coated biosensors. The time series RWG images are obtained and used to extract the optical signatures arising from the adhesion after the cells are dissociated from the spheroids and invade through the 3D Matrigel. Compound profiling shows that epidermal growth factor accelerates cancer cell invasion, while vandetanib, a multitarget kinase inhibitor, dose-dependently inhibits invasion. This study demonstrates that the label-free imager can monitor in real-time the invasion of spheroidal cancer cells through 3D matrices.},

abstract = {Breast cancer progression involves genetic changes and changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). To test the importance of the ECM in tumor cell dissemination, we cultured epithelium from primary human breast carcinomas in different ECM gels. We used basement membrane gels to model the normal microenvironment and collagen I to model the stromal ECM. In basement membrane gels, malignant epithelium either was indolent or grew collectively, without protrusions. In collagen I, epithelium from the same tumor invaded with protrusions and disseminated cells. Importantly, collagen I induced a similar initial response of protrusions and dissemination in both normal and malignant mammary epithelium. However, dissemination of normal cells into collagen I was transient and ceased as laminin 111 localized to the basal surface, whereas dissemination of carcinoma cells was sustained throughout culture, and laminin 111 was not detected. Despite the large impact of ECM on migration strategy, transcriptome analysis of our 3D cultures revealed few ECM-dependent changes in RNA expression. However, we observed many differences between normal and malignant epithelium, including reduced expression of cell-adhesion genes in tumors. Therefore, we tested whether deletion of an adhesion gene could induce sustained dissemination of nontransformed cells into collagen I. We found that deletion of P-cadherin was sufficient for sustained dissemination, but exclusively into collagen I. Our data reveal that metastatic tumors preferentially disseminate in specific ECM microenvironments. Furthermore, these data suggest that breaks in the basement membrane could induce invasion and dissemination via the resulting direct contact between cancer cells and collagen I.},

abstract = {Multicellular aggregates of cells, termed spheroids, are of interest for studying tumor behavior and for evaluating the response of pharmacologically active agents. Spheroids more faithfully reproduce the tumor macrostructure found invivo compared to classical 2D monolayers. We present a method for embedding spheroids within collagen gels followed by quantitative and qualitative whole spheroid and single cell analyses enabling characterization over the length scales from molecular to macroscopic. Spheroid producing and embedding capabilities are demonstrated for U2OS and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, of osteosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma origin, respectively. Finally, using the MDA-MB-231 tumor model, the chemotherapeutic response between paclitaxel delivery as a bolus dose, as practiced in the clinic, is compared to delivery within an expansile nanoparticle. The expansile nanoparticle delivery route provides a superior outcome and the results mirror those observed in a murine xenograft model. These findings highlight the synergistic beneficial results that may arise from the use of a drug deliverysystem, and the need to evaluate both drug candidates and delivery systems in the research and preclinical screening phases of a new cancer therapy development program. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The chemo-photothermal treatment consisted of DOX-loaded-poly(lactic co-glycolic acid)-Au half-shell nanoparticles with targeting moieties of anti-death receptor-4 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the Au surface. The cells or xenografted tumors treated with nanoparticles were exposed to near infrared light for 10min, which caused an increase in temperature to 45°C. Chemo-photothermal treatment resulted in a large reduction in the rate of tumor xenograft growth on DLD-1/DOX tumor-bearing mice with a much smaller dose of DOX than conventional DOX chemotherapy. These results demonstrate that targeted chemo-photothermal treatment can provide high therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The dynamics of filopodia interacting with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) play a key role in various cell-ECM interactions, but their mechanisms of interaction with the ECM in 3D environment remain poorly understood. Based on first principles, here we construct an individual-based, force-based computational model integrating four modules of 1) filopodia penetration dynamics; 2) intracellular mechanics of cellular and nuclear membranes, contractile actin stress fibers, and focal adhesion dynamics; 3) structural mechanics of ECM fiber networks; and 4) reaction-diffusion mass transfers of seven biochemical concentrations in related with chemotaxis, proteolysis, haptotaxis, and degradation in ECM to predict dynamic behaviors of filopodia that penetrate into a 3D ECM fiber network. The tip of each filopodium crawls along ECM fibers, tugs the surrounding fibers, and contracts or retracts depending on the strength of the binding and the ECM stiffness and pore size. This filopodium-ECM interaction is modeled as a stochastic process based on binding kinetics between integrins along the filopodial shaft and the ligands on the surrounding ECM fibers. This filopodia stochastic model is integrated into migratory dynamics of a whole cell in order to predict the cell invasion into 3D ECM in response to chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and durotaxis cues. Predicted average filopodia speed and that of the cell membrane advance agreed with experiments of 3D HUVEC migration at r2 {\textgreater} 0.95 for diverse ECMs with different pore sizes and stiffness.},

Besides E-cadherin loss, the best known ILC genetic hallmark, we identified mutations targeting PTEN, TBX3, and FOXA1 as ILC enriched features. PTEN loss associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, which was highest in ILC among all breast cancer subtypes. Spatially clustered FOXA1 mutations correlated with increased FOXA1 expression and activity. Conversely, GATA3 mutations and high expression characterized luminal A IDC, suggesting differential modulation of ER activity in ILC and IDC. Proliferation and immune-related signatures determined three ILC transcriptional subtypes associated with survival differences. Mixed IDC/ILC cases were molecularly classified as ILC-like and IDC-like revealing no true hybrid features.

abstract = {Lobular neoplasia (LN) is a term that encompasses both lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia. These lesions have been shown to constitute both risk indicators and nonobligate precursors of invasive breast cancer, they are relatively uncommon, and are most often identified in specimens taken for other reasons. Their incidence has increased in the last 2 decades, and novel variants, including a pleomorphic type, have been described. Loss of E-cadherin expression is recognized as a hallmark diagnostic feature of LN and invasive lobular carcinomas, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using anti-E-cadherin antibodies has been proven to be a useful method to differentiate between lobular and ductal lesions. The frequent use of E-cadherin IHC analysis in routine diagnostic histopathology, however, has resulted in confusion with regard to the actual value of IHC with antibodies against E-cadherin and other proteins of the cadherin-catenin complex. This review provides an update on recent clinicopathologic and molecular data on LN and invasive lobular carcinoma and a discussion about the use and limitations of IHC with E-cadherin in diagnostic breast pathology.},

Whereas for cathepsins B and L the role of active enzyme in invasion processes has been confirmed, cathepsin D was suggested to support tumour progression via its pro-peptide, rather than by its proteolytic activity. In this study we have compared the presence of active cathepsins B, L and D in ras-transformed human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A neoT) with their ability to invade matrigel. In this cell line high expression of all three cathepsins was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. The effect of proteolytic activity on cell invasion was studied by adding various natural and synthetic cysteine and aspartic proteinase inhibitors. The most effective compound was chicken cystatin, a general natural inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, (82.8+/-1.6{\%} inhibition of cell invasion), followed by the synthetic inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane (E-64). CLIK-148, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin L, showed a lower effect than chicken cystatin and E-64. Pepstatin A weakly inhibited invasion, whereas the same molar concentrations of squash aspartic proteinase (SQAPI)-like inhibitor, isolated from squash Cucurbita pepo, showed significant inhibition (65.7+/-1.8{\%}). We conclude that both cysteine and aspartic proteinase activities are needed for invasion by MCF-10A neoT cells in vitro.},

abstract = {We recently demonstrated that tissue kallikrein (TK) promotes keratinocyte migration through activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR(1)) and transactivation of the epi-dermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, we investigated the potential role of PAR(1) in mediating the effect of TK on cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Our results show that TK promotes DU145 prostate cancer cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner, but has no effect on A549 lung cancer cells. Active TK markedly increases DU145 cell migration and invasion, which are blocked by aprotinin but minimally affected by icatibant; kinin treatment has little effect. TK-induced cell migration and invasion are abolished by inhibition of PAR(1) using a pharmacological inhibitor or RNA interference. The effect of TK on cell migration and invasion are also blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C, c-Src, matrix metalloproteinase, EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, TK stimulates ERK phosphorylation, which is inhibited by an EGFR antagonist. Additionally, TK but not kinin stimulates DU145 cell proliferation through activation of the kinin B2 receptor, but not PAR(1) and EGFR. These results indicate differential signaling pathways mediated by TK in promoting prostate cancer cell migration and invasion via PAR(1) activation, and proliferation via kinin B2 receptor stimulation.},

abstract = {The aspartyl protease cathepsin D has been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis when found at high levels in primary breast tumors. It has been suggested that this is because the production of cathepsin D increases the invasive potential of the tumor cells, thus increasing the probability of metastasis. We have therefore conducted experiments to determine if secreted cathepsin D makes a significant contribution to the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells in the Boyden chamber assay of invasion, which measures the ability of a cell to invade through an artificial basement membrane. Cathepsin D secretion and Boyden chamber invasiveness were measured in nine clones of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and no correlation was found between cathepsin secretion and invasive behavior. Invasion assays were also conducted in the presence of the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A, and no inhibition of the invasive behavior of cells was seen. Since low-pH environments are required for both the activation of pro-cathepsin D and the activity of the mature enzyme, assays were also conducted in the presence of chloroquine to neutralize the pH in the acidic compartments of the cells. This treatment did not inhibit invasiveness. Cathepsin D secretion by the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-468, SK-Br-3, and MCF-7-ADRr was also measured. Again, there was no correlation with invasion. In fact, cathepsin D levels were inversely correlated with aggressive behavior in vivo and in vitro in previously reported studies. These data suggest that cathepsin D secretion by tumor cells is not an important determinant of the invasiveness of the tumor cells per se. These data also reinforce the view that the poor prognosis in clinical breast cancer linked to high tumor levels of cathepsin D is probably due to high levels of cathepsin D in the stromal components of the tumor such as infiltrating inflammatory cells.},

However, very few examples exist of extensions of this approach to bacterial targets. We now report the first high-throughput, high-content platform for the prediction of antibiotic modes of action using image-based screening. This approach employs a unique feature segmentation and extraction protocol to quantify key size and shape metrics of bacterial cells over a range of compound concentrations, and matches the trajectories of these metrics to those of training set compounds of known molecular target to predict the test compound's mode of action. This approach has been used to successfully predict the modes of action of a panel of known antibiotics, and has been extended to the evaluation of natural products libraries for the de novo prediction of compound function directly from primary screening data.},

abstract = {Traditional natural products discovery using a combination of live/ dead screening followed by iterative bioassay-guided fractionation affords no information about compound structure or mode of action until late in the discovery process. This leads to high rates of rediscovery and low probabilities of finding compounds with unique biological and/or chemical properties. By integrating image- based phenotypic screening in HeLa cells with high-resolution untar- geted metabolomics analysis, we have developed a new platform, termed Compound Activity Mapping, that is capable of directly pre- dicting the identities and modes of action of bioactive constituents for any complex natural product extract library. This new tool can be used to rapidly identify novel bioactive constituents and provide predictions of compound modes of action directly from primary screening data. This approach inverts the natural products discovery process from the existing ‟grind and find” model to a targeted, hypothesis-driven discovery model where the chemical features and biological function of bioactive metabolites are known early in the screening workflow, and lead compounds can be rationally selected based on biological and/or chemical novelty. We demon- strate the utility of the Compound Activity Mapping platform by combining 10,977mass spectral features and 58,032 biologicalmea- surements from a library of 234 natural products extracts and in- tegrating these two datasets to identify 13 clusters of fractions containing 11 known compound families and four newcompounds.

Most of these breakthrough medicines are monoclonal antibodies that block protein-protein interactions between T cell checkpoint receptors and their cognate ligands. In addition, genetically engineered autologous T cell therapies have also recently demonstrated significant clinical responses in haematological cancers. Conspicuously missing from this class of therapies are traditional small-molecule drugs, which have previously served as the backbone of targeted cancer therapies. Modulating the immune system through a small-molecule approach offers several unique advantages that are complementary to, and potentially synergistic with, biologic modalities. This Review highlights immuno-oncology pathways and mechanisms that can be best or solely targeted by small-molecule medicines. Agents aimed at these mechanisms--modulation of the immune response, trafficking to the tumour microenvironment and cellular infiltration--are poised to significantly extend the scope of immuno-oncology applications and enhance the opportunities for combination with tumour-targeted agents and biologic immunotherapies.},

Here, we describe the selection and targeted modification of novel single-domain antibodies, so-called nanobodies, to trace vimentin in various cellular assays. Most importantly, we generated vimentin chromobodies by combining the binding moieties of the nanobodies with fluorescent proteins. Following chromobody fluorescence in a cancer-relevant cellular model, we were able for the first time to monitor and quantify dynamic changes of endogenous vimentin upon siRNA-mediated knockdown, induction with TGF-$\beta$ and modification with Withaferin A by high-content imaging. This versatile approach allows detailed studies of the spatiotemporal organization of vimentin in living cells. It enables the identification of vimentin-modulating compounds, thereby providing the basis to screen for novel therapeutics affecting EMT.},

Development of higher throughput assays to quantify phenotypic changes in spheroids is an active area of investigation. The goal of this study was to develop higher throughput high-content imaging and analysis methods to characterize phenotypic changes in human cancer spheroids in response to compound treatment. We optimized spheroid cell culture protocols using low adhesion U-bottom 96- and 384-well plates for three common cancer cell lines and improved the workflow with a one-step staining procedure that reduces assay time and minimizes variability. We streamlined imaging acquisition by using a maximum projection algorithm that combines cellular information from multiple slices through a 3D object into a single image, enabling efficient comparison of different spheroid phenotypes. A custom image analysis method was implemented to provide multiparametric characterization of single-cell and spheroid phenotypes. We report a number of readouts, including quantification of marker-specific cell numbers, measurement of cell viability and apoptosis, and characterization of spheroid size and shape. Assay performance was assessed using established anticancer cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs. We demonstrated concentration-response effects for different readouts and measured IC50 values, comparing 3D spheroid results to two-dimensional cell cultures. Finally, a library of 119 approved anticancer drugs was screened across a wide range of concentrations using HCT116 colon cancer spheroids. The proposed methods can increase performance and throughput of high-content assays for compound screening and evaluation of anticancer drugs with 3D cell models.},

abstract = {Most cancers in humans are large, measuring centimetres in diameter, and composed of many billions of cells. An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell division. What is remarkable about cancers is that virtually every neoplastic cell within a large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that emerge late during tumour growth. How such alterations expand within the spatially constrained three-dimensional architecture of a tumour, and come to dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has been unclear. Here we describe a model for tumour evolution that shows how short-range dispersal and cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumour. We show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large tumour allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model not only provides insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumour growth, but also suggests that targeting short-range cellular migratory activity could have marked effects on tumour growth rates.},

Using quantitative imaging of single living tumor cells invading three-dimensional collagen matrices, in tandem with unsupervised computational analysis, we found that melanoma cells can switch between amoeboid and mesenchymal forms via two different routes in shape space--an apolar and polar route. We show that whereas particular Rho-family GTPases are required for the morphogenesis of amoeboid and mesenchymal forms, others are required for transitions via the apolar or polar route and not amoeboid or mesenchymal morphogenesis per se. Altering the transition rates between particular routes by depleting Rho-family GTPases can change the morphological heterogeneity of cell populations. The apolar and polar routes may have evolved in order to facilitate conversion between amoeboid and mesenchymal forms, as cells are either searching for, or attracted to, particular migratory cues, respectively.},

Cellular phenotypes can be characterized by multivariate image readouts such as shape, intensity, or texture. The corresponding feature vectors can thus be defined as HCS fingerprints that serve as a powerful biological compound descriptor. Therefore, clustering or classification of HCS fingerprints across compound treatments allows for the identification of similarities in protein targets or pathways. We developed an HCS-based profiling panel that serves as basis for characterizing the mode of action of compounds. This panel measures phenotypic effects in six different compartments of U-2OS cells, namely the nucleus, the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the cytoskeleton. We profiled a set of 2,725 well-annotated compounds and clustered their corresponding HCS fingerprints to establish links between predominant cellular phenotypes and cellular processes and protein targets. We found various different clusters enriched for individual targets (e.g., HDAC, HSP90, TOP1, HMGCR, TUB), signaling pathways (e.g., PIK3/AKT/mTOR), or gene sets associated with diseases (e.g., psoriasis, leukemia). Based on this clustering we were able to identify novel compound-target associations for selected compounds such as a submicromolar inhibitory activity of Silmitasertib (a casein kinase inhibitor) on PI3K and mTOR.},

We find that a large number of radiomic features have prognostic power in independent data sets of lung and head-and-neck cancer patients, many of which were not identified as significant before. Radiogenomics analysis reveals that a prognostic radiomic signature, capturing intratumour heterogeneity, is associated with underlying gene-expression patterns. These data suggest that radiomics identifies a general prognostic phenotype existing in both lung and head-and-neck cancer. This may have a clinical impact as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision-support in cancer treatment at low cost.},

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) does not show immunohistochemical expression of oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or HER2. At present, no suitable treatment option is available for patients with TNBC. This dearth of effective conventional therapies for the treatment of advanced stage breast cancer has provoked the development of novel strategies for the management of patients with TNBC. This review presents recent information associated with different therapeutic options for the treatment of TNBC focusing on promising targets such as the Notch signalling, Wnt/$\beta$-catenin and Hedgehog pathways, in addition to EGFR, PARP1, mTOR, TGF-$\beta$ and angiogenesis inhibitors.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration is a key process underlying the morphogenesis of many organs as well as tumour invasion, which very often involves heterogeneous cell populations. Here we investigated how such populations can migrate cohesively in the Drosophila posterior midgut, comprised of epithelial and mesenchymal cells and show a novel role for the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin (E-Cad) in mesenchymal cells. Despite a lack of junctions at the ultrastructure level, reducing E-Cad levels causes mesenchymal cells to detach from one another and from neighbouring epithelial cells; as a result, coordination between the two populations is lost. Moreover, Bazooka and recycling mechanisms are also required for E-Cad accumulation in mesenchymal cells. These results indicate an active role for E-Cad in mediating cohesive and ordered migration of non-epithelial cells, and discount the notion of E-Cad as just an epithelial feature that has to be switched off to enable migration of mesenchymal cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is overwhelming evidence that in vitro three-dimensional tumor cell cultures more accurately reflect the complex in vivo microenvironment than simple two-dimensional cell monolayers, not least with respect to gene expression profiles, signaling pathway activity and drug sensitivity. However, most currently available three-dimensional techniques are time consuming and/or lack reproducibility; thus standardized and rapid protocols are urgently needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address this requirement, we have developed a versatile toolkit of reproducible three-dimensional tumor spheroid models for dynamic, automated, quantitative imaging and analysis that are compatible with routine high-throughput preclinical studies. Not only do these microplate methods measure three-dimensional tumor growth, but they have also been significantly enhanced to facilitate a range of functional assays exemplifying additional key hallmarks of cancer, namely cell motility and matrix invasion. Moreover, mutual tissue invasion and angiogenesis is accommodated by coculturing tumor spheroids with murine embryoid bodies within which angiogenic differentiation occurs. Highly malignant human tumor cells were selected to exemplify therapeutic effects of three specific molecularly-targeted agents: PI-103 (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor) and CCT130234 (in-house phospholipase C (PLC)$\gamma$ inhibitor). Fully automated analysis using a Celigo cytometer was validated for tumor spheroid growth and invasion against standard image analysis techniques, with excellent reproducibility and significantly increased throughput. In addition, we discovered key differential sensitivities to targeted agents between two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, and also demonstrated enhanced potency of some agents against cell migration/invasion compared with proliferation, suggesting their preferential utility in metastatic disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have established and validated a suite of highly reproducible tumor microplate three-dimensional functional assays to enhance the biological relevance of early preclinical cancer studies. We believe these assays will increase the translational predictive value of in vitro drug evaluation studies and reduce the need for in vivo studies by more effective triaging of compounds.},

abstract = {Androgens are C-19 steroids that provide major regulatory influences on male reproductive function. Testosterone, the principal androgenic steroid, is secreted by the Leydig cells of the testes. Both testosterone and its 5 alpha reduced derivative 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are physiological ligands for the androgen receptor (AR). Ligand-activated AR acts as a nuclear transcription factor and mediates androgen action. AR, along with receptors for a number of C-21 steroids such as glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progesterone, share the same 15 base pair consensus element composed of 5'-GGA/TACAnnnTGTTCT-3'. Despite this cross-reactivity at the level of the DNA, physiologically, androgens regulate their target genes with a high degree of receptor specificity. Such a regulatory specificity appears to be due to multiphasic interactions involving enzymatic activation/inactivation of the steroid ligand, interaction with specific receptor-associated nuclear factors on or around the hormone response element, and differential regulation of the receptor gene expression. Conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in target cells is a widespread activation mechanism that amplifies the androgenic signal. Unlike the testosterone-AR complex, DHT-activated AR has a longer half-life, and thus prolongs androgen action. Oxido-reduction of androgens by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and sulfurylation by androgen sulfotransferase are two major pathways of androgen inactivation in target cells. Prenatal deprivation of androgen action, due to mutations in either the AR or the 5 alpha-reductase gene, results in developmental abnormalities of male reproductive tissues and also cause partial or complete androgen-insensitivity syndromes. Elucidation of various molecular steps in androgen action is allowing development of improved therapeutic agents for the management of disorders of androgen action such as the prostatic hypertrophy and neoplasia.},

While the RhoGEF Lfc has been implicated in this cytoskeleton coupling process, it has remained elusive how Lfc is recruited to microtubules and how microtubule recruitment moderates Lfc activity. Here, we demonstrate that the dynein light chain protein Tctex-1 is required for localization of Lfc to microtubules. Lfc residues 139-161 interact with Tctex-1 at a site distinct from the cleft that binds dynein intermediate chain. An NMR-based GEF assay revealed that interaction with Tctex-1 represses Lfc nucleotide exchange activity in an indirect manner that requires both polymerized microtubules and phosphorylation of S885 by PKA. We show that inhibition of Lfc by Tctex-1 is dynein dependent. These studies demonstrate a pivotal role of Tctex-1 as a negative regulator of actin filament organization through its control of Lfc in the crosstalk between microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {One goal of cell biology is to understand how cells adopt different shapes in response to varying environmental and cellular conditions. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cell shape and environment requires a systems-level understanding of the signalling networks that respond to external cues and regulate the cytoskeleton. Classical biochemical and genetic approaches have identified thousands of individual components that contribute to cell shape, but it remains difficult to predict how cell shape is generated by the activity of these components using bottom-up approaches because of the complex nature of their interactions in space and time. Here, we describe the regulation of cellular shape by signalling systems using a top-down approach. We first exploit the shape diversity generated by systematic RNAi screening and comprehensively define the shape space a migratory cell explores. We suggest a simple Boolean model involving the activation of Rac and Rho GTPases in two compartments to explain the basis for all cell shapes in the dataset. Critically, we also generate a probabilistic graphical model to show how cells explore this space in a deterministic, rather than a stochastic, fashion. We validate the predictions made by our model using live-cell imaging. Our work explains how cross-talk between Rho and Rac can generate different cell shapes, and thus morphological heterogeneity, in genetically identical populations.},

However, their activity cannot be restricted to specific target cells, which also causes severe side effects in chemotherapy. Here, we introduce the photostatins, inhibitors that can be switched on and off in vivo by visible light, to optically control microtubule dynamics. Photostatins modulate microtubule dynamics with a subsecond response time and control mitosis in living organisms with single-cell spatial precision. In longer-term applications in cell culture, photostatins are up to 250 times more cytotoxic when switched on with blue light than when kept in the dark. Therefore, photostatins are both valuable tools for cell biology, and are promising as a new class of precision chemotherapeutics whose toxicity may be spatiotemporally constrained using light.},

abstract = {Accurate and reproducible quantification of the accumulation of proteins into foci in cells is essential for data interpretation and for biological inferences. To improve reproducibility, much emphasis has been placed on the preparation of samples, but less attention has been given to reporting and standardizing the quantification of foci. The current standard to quantitate foci in open-source software is to manually determine a range of parameters based on the outcome of one or a few representative images and then apply the parameter combination to the analysis of a larger dataset. Here, we demonstrate the power and utility of using machine learning to train a new algorithm (FindFoci) to determine optimal parameters. FindFoci closely matches human assignments and allows rapid automated exploration of parameter space. Thus, individuals can train the algorithm to mirror their own assignments and then automate focus counting using the same parameters across a large number of images. Using the training algorithm to match human assignments of foci, we demonstrate that applying an optimal parameter combination from a single image is not broadly applicable to analysis of other images scored by the same experimenter or by other experimenters. Our analysis thus reveals wide variation in human assignment of foci and their quantification. To overcome this, we developed training on multiple images, which reduces the inconsistency of using a single or a few images to set parameters for focus detection. FindFoci is provided as an open-source plugin for ImageJ.},

Increasingly, high-content screens have come to rely on supervised machine learning (SML) to perform automatic phenotypic classification as an essential step of the analysis. However, this comes at a cost, namely, the labeled examples required to train the predictive model. Classification performance increases with the number of labeled examples, and because labeling examples demands time from an expert, the training process represents a significant time investment. Active learning strategies attempt to overcome this bottleneck by presenting the most relevant examples to the annotator, thereby achieving high accuracy while minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data. In this article, we investigate the impact of active learning on single-cell-based phenotype recognition, using data from three large-scale RNA interference high-content screens representing diverse phenotypic profiling problems. We consider several combinations of active learning strategies and popular SML methods. Our results show that active learning significantly reduces the time cost and can be used to reveal the same phenotypic targets identified using SML. We also identify combinations of active learning strategies and SML methods which perform better than others on the phenotypic profiling problems we studied.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of high-throughput automated image acquisition technologies has forever changed how cell biologists collect and analyze data. Historically, the interpretation of cellular phenotypes in different experimental conditions has been dependent upon the expert opinions of well-trained biologists. Such qualitative analysis is particularly effective in detecting subtle, but important, deviations in phenotypes. However, while the rapid and continuing development of automated microscope-based technologies now facilitates the acquisition of trillions of cells in thousands of diverse experimental conditions, such as in the context of RNA interference (RNAi) or small-molecule screens, the massive size of these datasets precludes human analysis. Thus, the development of automated methods which aim to identify novel and biological relevant phenotypes online is one of the major challenges in high-throughput image-based screening. Ideally, phenotype discovery methods should be designed to utilize prior/existing information and tackle three challenging tasks, i.e. restoring pre-defined biological meaningful phenotypes, differentiating novel phenotypes from known ones and clarifying novel phenotypes from each other. Arbitrarily extracted information causes biased analysis, while combining the complete existing datasets with each new image is intractable in high-throughput screens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present the design and implementation of a novel and robust online phenotype discovery method with broad applicability that can be used in diverse experimental contexts, especially high-throughput RNAi screens. This method features phenotype modelling and iterative cluster merging using improved gap statistics. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed to estimate the distribution of each existing phenotype, and then used as reference distribution in gap statistics. This method is broadly applicable to a number of different types of image-based datasets derived from a wide spectrum of experimental conditions and is suitable to adaptively process new images which are continuously added to existing datasets. Validations were carried out on different dataset, including published RNAi screening using Drosophila embryos [Additional files 1, 2], dataset for cell cycle phase identification using HeLa cells [Additional files 1, 3, 4] and synthetic dataset using polygons, our methods tackled three aforementioned tasks effectively with an accuracy range of 85{\%}-90{\%}. When our method is implemented in the context of a Drosophila genome-scale RNAi image-based screening of cultured cells aimed to identifying the contribution of individual genes towards the regulation of cell-shape, it efficiently discovers meaningful new phenotypes and provides novel biological insight. We also propose a two-step procedure to modify the novelty detection method based on one-class SVM, so that it can be used to online phenotype discovery. In different conditions, we compared the SVM based method with our method using various datasets and our methods consistently outperformed SVM based method in at least two of three tasks by 2{\%} to 5{\%}. These results demonstrate that our methods can be used to better identify novel phenotypes in image-based datasets from a wide range of conditions and organisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that our method can detect various novel phenotypes effectively in complex datasets. Experiment results also validate that our method performs consistently under different order of image input, variation of starting conditions including the number and composition of existing phenotypes, and dataset from different screens. In our findings, the proposed method is suitable for online phenotype discovery in diverse high-throughput image-based genetic and chemical screens.},

abstract = {Although a great deal is known about the signaling events that promote nuclear translocation of NF-$\kappa$B, how cellular biophysics and the microenvironment might regulate the dynamics of this pathway is poorly understood. In this study, we used high-content image analysis and Bayesian network modeling to ask whether cell shape and context features influence NF-$\kappa$B activation using the inherent variability present in unperturbed populations of breast tumor and non-tumor cell lines. Cell-cell contact, cell and nuclear area, and protrusiveness all contributed to variability in NF-$\kappa$B localization in the absence and presence of TNF$\alpha$. Higher levels of nuclear NF-$\kappa$B were associated with mesenchymal-like versus epithelial-like morphologies, and RhoA-ROCK-myosin II signaling was critical for mediating shape-based differences in NF-$\kappa$B localization and oscillations. Thus, mechanical factors such as cell shape and the microenvironment can influence NF-$\kappa$B signaling and may in part explain how different phenotypic outcomes can arise from the same chemical cues.},

abstract = {The way in which cells adopt different morphologies is not fully understood. Cell shape could be a continuous variable or restricted to a set of discrete forms. We developed quantitative methods to describe cell shape and show that Drosophila haemocytes in culture are a heterogeneous mixture of five discrete morphologies. In an RNAi screen of genes affecting the morphological complexity of heterogeneous cell populations, we found that most genes regulate the transition between discrete shapes rather than generating new morphologies. In particular, we identified a subset of genes, including the tumour suppressor PTEN, that decrease the heterogeneity of the population, leading to populations enriched in rounded or elongated forms. We show that these genes have a highly conserved function as regulators of cell shape in both mouse and human metastatic melanoma cells.},

abstract = {We have implemented an unbiased cell morphology-based screen to identify small-molecule modulators of cellular processes using the Cytometrix (TM) automated imaging and analysis system. This assay format provides unbiased analysis of morphological effects induced by small molecules by capturing phenotypic readouts of most known classes of pharmacological agents and has the potential to read out pathways for which little is known. Four human-cancer cell lines and one noncancerous primary cell type were treated with 107 small molecules comprising four different protein kinase-inhibitor scaffolds. Cellular phenotypes induced by each compound were quantified by multivariate statistical analysis of the morphology, staining intensity, and spatial attributes of the cellular nuclei, microtubules, and Golgi compartments. Principal component analysis was used to identify inhibitors of cellular components not targeted by known protein kinase inhibitors. Here we focus on a hydroxyl-substituted analog (hydroxy-PP) of the known Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 because it induced cell-specific morphological features distinct from all known kinase inhibitors in the collection. We used affinity purification to identify a target of hydroxy-PP, carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a short-chain dehydrogenase-reductase. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of the CBR1/hydroxy-PP complex to 1.24 A resolution. Structure-based design of more potent and selective CBR1 inhibitors provided probes for analyzing the biological function of CBR1 in A549 cells. These studies revealed a previously unknown function for CBR1 in serum-withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Further studies indicate CBR1 inhibitors may enhance the effectiveness of anticancer anthracyclines. Morphology-based screening of diverse cancer cell types has provided a method for discovering potent new small-molecule probes for cell biological studies and anticancer drug candidates.},

Distance measurements and hierarchical clustering methods lead to a profound understanding of different high-content screening readouts.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Evaluation of previous systems for automated determination of subcellular location from microscope images has been done using datasets in which each location class consisted of multiple images of the same representative protein. Here, we frame a more challenging and useful problem where previously unseen proteins are to be classified. RESULTS: Using CD-tagging, we generated two new image datasets for evaluation of this problem, which contain several different proteins for each location class. Evaluation of previous methods on these new datasets showed that it is much harder to train a classifier that generalizes across different proteins than one that simply recognizes a protein it was trained on. We therefore developed and evaluated additional approaches, incorporating novel modifications of local features techniques. These extended the notion of local features to exploit both the protein image and any reference markers that were imaged in parallel. With these, we obtained a large accuracy improvement in our new datasets over existing methods. Additionally, these features help achieve classification improvements for other previously studied datasets.

abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group of cancers, and subtyping is necessary to better identify molecular-based therapies. In this study, we analyzed gene expression (GE) profiles from 21 breast cancer data sets and identified 587 TNBC cases. Cluster analysis identified 6 TNBC subtypes displaying unique GE and ontologies, including 2 basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Further, GE analysis allowed us to identify TNBC cell line models representative of these subtypes. Predicted "driver" signaling pathways were pharmacologically targeted in these cell line models as proof of concept that analysis of distinct GE signatures can inform therapy selection. BL1 and BL2 subtypes had higher expression of cell cycle and DNA damage response genes, and representative cell lines preferentially responded to cisplatin. M and MSL subtypes were enriched in GE for epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and growth factor pathways and cell models responded to NVP-BEZ235 (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and dasatinib (an abl/src inhibitor). The LAR subtype includes patients with decreased relapse-free survival and was characterized by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. LAR cell lines were uniquely sensitive to bicalutamide (an AR antagonist). These data may be useful in biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial design that will enable alignment of TNBC patients to appropriate targeted therapies.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in United States women, accounting for {\textgreater}40,000 deaths each year. These breast tumors are comprised of phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells. Using a model in which human breast cancer cells were grown in immunocompromised mice, we found that only a minority of breast cancer cells had the ability to form new tumors. We were able to distinguish the tumorigenic (tumor initiating) from the nontumorigenic cancer cells based on cell surface marker expression. We prospectively identified and isolated the tumorigenic cells as CD44(+)CD24(-/low)Lineage(-) in eight of nine patients. As few as 100 cells with this phenotype were able to form tumors in mice, whereas tens of thousands of cells with alternate phenotypes failed to form tumors. The tumorigenic subpopulation could be serially passaged: each time cells within this population generated new tumors containing additional CD44(+)CD24(-/low)Lineage(-) tumorigenic cells as well as the phenotypically diverse mixed populations of nontumorigenic cells present in the initial tumor. The ability to prospectively identify tumorigenic cancer cells will facilitate the elucidation of pathways that regulate their growth and survival. Furthermore, because these cells drive tumor development, strategies designed to target this population may lead to more effective therapies.},

abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16{\%} of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36{\%} of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

abstract = {Basal-like and luminal breast tumors have distinct clinical behavior and molecular profiles, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. To interrogate processes that determine these distinct phenotypes and their inheritance pattern, we generated somatic cell fusions and performed integrated genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation and chromatin) profiling. We found that the basal-like trait is generally dominant and is largely defined by epigenetic repression of luminal transcription factors. Definition of super-enhancers highlighted a core program common in luminal cells but a high degree of heterogeneity in basal-like breast cancers that correlates with clinical outcome. We also found that protein extracts of basal-like cells are sufficient to induce a luminal-to-basal phenotypic switch, implying a trigger of basal-like autoregulatory circuits. We determined that KDM6A might be required for luminal-basal fusions, and we identified EN1, TBX18, and TCF4 as candidate transcriptional regulators of the luminal-to-basal switch. Our findings highlight the remarkable epigenetic plasticity of breast cancer cells. Luminal and basal-like breast tumors are clinically distinct. Using somatic cell fusions, Su et al. demonstrate the general dominance of the basal-like phenotype. Epigenomic profiling of parental luminal and basal-like cells and heterofusions define common luminal programs but a high degree of heterogeneity in basal-like cancer cells.},

abstract = {One of the hallmarks of cancer is aberrant DNA methylation, which is associated with abnormal gene expression. Both hypermethylation and silencing of tumour suppressor genes as well as hypomethylation and activation of prometastatic genes are characteristic of cancer cells. As DNA methylation is reversible, DNA methylation inhibitors were tested as anticancer drugs with the idea that such agents would demethylate and reactivate tumour suppressor genes. Two cytosine analogues, 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration as antitumour agents in 2004 and 2006 respectively. However, these agents might cause activation of a panel of prometastatic genes in addition to activating tumour suppressor genes, which might lead to increased metastasis. This poses the challenge of how to target tumour suppressor genes and block cancer growth with DNA-demethylating drugs while avoiding the activation of prometastatic genes and precluding the morbidity of cancer metastasis. This paper reviews current progress in using DNA methylation inhibitors in cancer therapy and the potential promise and challenges ahead.},

This method allows a large data reduction while retaining relevant information, and the data-derived factors used to quantify phenotype have discernable biological meaning. We used factor analysis of cells stained with fluorescent markers of cell cycle state to profile a compound library and cluster the hits into seven phenotypic categories. We then compared phenotypic profiles, chemical similarity and predicted protein binding activities of active compounds. By integrating these different descriptors of measured and potential biological activity, we can effectively draw mechanism-of-action inferences.},

abstract = {The functions of aminotelopeptide and N-terminal cross-linking of collagen I were examined. Acetic acid-soluble collagen I (ASC) was purified from neonatal bovine skin and treated with three kinds of proteases. The amino acid sequencing analysis of the N terminus showed that ASC contained a full-length aminotelopeptide. Pepsin and papain cleaved the aminotelopeptide of the alpha1 chain at the same site and the aminotelopeptide of the alpha2 chain at different sites. Proctase-treated ASC lost the whole aminotelopeptide, and the N-terminal sequence began from the tenth residue inside the triple helical region. The rates of fibril formation of pepsin-treated ASC and proctase-treated ASC were the same and were slower than that of ASC. The denaturation temperatures, monitored by CD ellipticity at 221 nm, of ASC, pepsin-treated, or papain-treated collagens were the same at 41.8 degrees C. Proctase-treated ASC showed a lower denaturation temperature of 39.9 degrees C. We also observed the morphology of the collagen fibrils under an electron microscope. The ASC fibrils were straight and thin, whereas the fibrils of pepsin-treated ASC were slightly twisted, and the fibrils from papain- and proctase-treated ASC were highly twisted and thick. When the collagen gel strength was examined by a modified method of viscosity-measurement, ASC was the strongest, followed by pepsin-treated ASC, and papain- and proctase-treated ASCs were the weakest. These results suggest that the aminotelopeptide plays important roles in fibril formation and thermal stability. In addition, the functions of intermolecular cross-linking in aminotelopeptides may contribute to the formation of fibrils in the correct staggered pattern and to strengthening the collagen gel.},

abstract = {Metastases can develop after apparently successful treatment of a primary tumour, sometimes following a period of tumour dormancy that can last for years. However, factors that regulate metastatic tumour dormancy remain poorly understood. Here we review the potential contribution of interactions between tumour cells and the microenvironment in metastatic sites, in regulating tumour dormancy vs. metastatic growth. We focus particularly on the potential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulating maintenance and release from dormancy. Tumour cells that fail to properly adhere to the ECM may enter a state of dormancy. The molecular and physical composition of the ECM can be affected by tumour cells themselves, as well as multiple stromal cell types. The roles of integrins, fibronectin, and collagen are discussed, as are factors that can change the ECM. A better understanding of the molecular details of the crosstalk between tumour cells and the ECM in secondary sites, and how these regulate the dormant state, may lead to improved therapeutic strategies to induce or maintain disseminated tumour cells in a dormant state, or alternatively to successfully eradicate dormant cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, these NC1 domains were shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Here, we provide evidence that a recombinant form of the $\alpha$2(IV)NC1 domain of type-IV collagen could bind integrins $\alpha$1$\beta$1 and $\alpha$v$\beta$3 expressed on melanoma cells and inhibit tumor cell adhesion in a ligand-specific manner. Systemic administration of recombinant $\alpha$2(IV)NC1 domain potently inhibited M21 melanoma tumor growth within full thickness human skin and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice. Interestingly, $\alpha$2(IV)NC1 domain enhanced cellular senescence in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that recombinant $\alpha$2(IV)NC1 domain is not only a potent anti-angiogenic reagent, but it also directly impacts tumor cell behavior.

Here we demonstrate that human M24met melanoma cells remain responsive to growth regulatory signals that result from contact with type I collagen and that the effect on proliferation depends on the physical structure of the collagen. On polymerized fibrillar collagen, M24met cells are growth arrested at the G(1)/S checkpoint and maintain high levels of p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein. In contrast, on nonfibrillar (denatured) collagen, the cells enter the cell cycle, and p27(KIP1) is down-regulated. These growth regulatory effects involve contact between type I collagen and the collagen-binding integrin alpha(2)beta(1), which appears restricted in the presence of fibrillar collagen. Thus melanoma cells remain sensitive to negative growth regulatory signals originating from fibrillar collagen, and the proteolytic degradation of fibrils is a mechanism allowing tumor cells to escape these restrictive signals.},

Two components of the cellular response to a basement membrane overlay that result in the expression of the milk protein beta-casein were defined. The first component of this response involves a rounding and clustering of the cells that can be physically mimicked by plating the cells on a nonadhesive substratum. The second component is biochemical in nature, and it is associated with beta 1 integrin clustering and increased tyrosine phosphorylation. The second component is initiated in a morphology-independent manner, but the proper translation of this biochemical signal into a functional response requires cell rounding and cell clustering.

We have now used this assay to identify reversion and/or death requirements of several more aggressive human breast cancer cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Breast tumor cell lines MCF7, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in 3D rBM and treated with inhibitors of beta1 integrin, MAPK, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). MDA-MB-231 cells, which lack E-cadherin, were transfected with an E-cadherin cDNA. The extent of reversion was assessed by changes in morphology and polarity, growth in 3D rBM or soft agar, level of invasiveness, and tumor formation in nude mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All three cell lines showed partial reversion (MCF7 the greatest and Hs578T the least) of tumorigenic properties treated with a single beta1 integrin, MAPK, or PI3K inhibitor. Combined inhibition of beta1 integrin and either PI3K or MAPK resulted in nearly complete phenotypic reversion (MDA-MB-231, MCF7) or in cell death (Hs578T). E-cadherin-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells showed partial reversion, but exposure of the transfectants to an inhibitor of beta1 integrin, PI3K, or MAPK led to nearly complete reversion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The 3D rBM assay can be used to identify signaling pathways that, when manipulated in concert, can lead to the restoration of morphologically normal breast structures or to death of the tumor cells, even highly metastatic cells. This approach may be useful to design therapeutic intervention strategies for aggressive breast cancers.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural and biochemical signals that regulate cell function. A well-controlled balance between cells and surroundings (i.e., dynamic reciprocity) is crucial for regulating ECM architecture. During cancer progression, epithelial cells undergo genetic alterations which, together with stromal changes including ECM remodeling, disturb the homeostatic dynamics of the epithelium. A parallel organization of stromal ECM fibrils is associated with tumorigenic responses. In an emerging paradigm, continuous and progressive regulation via mechanical forces and aberrant signaling are believed to be responsible for tumor-associated ECM remodeling. In this review we discuss the discrete biomechanical and biochemical mechanisms that underlie these architectural changes and highlight their particular relevance to the regulation of the alignment of ECM in the mesenchymal stroma.},

abstract = {Extracellular pH (pH(e)) is lower in many tumors than in the corresponding normal tissue. The significance of acidic pH(e) in the development of metastatic disease was investigated in the present work. Human melanoma cells (A-07, D-12, and T-22) were cultured in vitro at pH(e) 6.8 or 7.4 (control) before being inoculated into the tail vein of BALB/c nu/nu mice for formation of experimental pulmonary metastases. Cell invasiveness was studied in vitro by using Matrigel invasion chambers and angiogenesis was studied in vivo by using an intradermal assay. Protein secretion was measured by ELISA and immunocapture assays. Cells cultured at acidic pH(e) showed increased secretion of proteinases and proangiogenic factors, enhanced invasive and angiogenic potential, and enhanced potential to develop experimental metastases. Acidity-induced metastasis was inhibited by treatment with the general matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001, the general cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64, or blocking antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) or interleukin-8 (IL-8). Our study indicates that acidic pH(e) promotes experimental pulmonary metastasis in A-07, D-12, and T-22 human melanoma cells by a common mechanism involving acidity-induced up-regulation of the proteolytic enzymes MMP-2, MMP-9, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L and acidity-induced up-regulation of the proangiogenic factors VEGF-A and IL-8. One consequence of this observation is that treatment strategies involving deliberate tumor acidification to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and hyperthermia should be avoided. Moreover, the possibility that the pH(e) of the primary tumor may be an important prognostic parameter for melanoma patients merits clinical investigation.},

As the primary receptors involved in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins present on the surface of tumor and stromal cells have a profound impact on the ability to survive in specific locations, but in some cases, these receptors can also function in the absence of ligand binding to promote stemness and survival in the presence of environmental and therapeutic stresses. Understanding how integrin expression and function is regulated in this context will enable the development of new therapeutic approaches to sensitize tumors to therapy and suppress their metastatic phenotype.},

abstract = {Active matrix metalloproteinases and degraded collagen are observed in disease states, such as atherosclerosis. To examine whether degraded collagen fragments have distinct effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), collagenase-digested type I collagen was added to cultured human arterial SMC. After addition of collagen fragments, adherent SMC lose their focal adhesion structures and round up. Analysis of components of the focal adhesion complex demonstrates rapid cleavage of the focal adhesion kinase (pp125(FAK)), paxillin, and talin. Cleavage is suppressed by inhibitors of the proteolytic enzyme, calpain I. In vitro translated pp125(FAK) is a substrate for both calpain I- and II-mediated processing. Mapping of the proteolytic cleavage fragments of pp125(FAK) predicts a dissociation of the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence and second proline-rich domain from the tyrosine kinase domain and integrin-binding sequence. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirm that the ability of pp125(FAK) to associate with paxillin, vinculin, and p130cas is significantly reduced in SMC treated with degraded collagen fragments. Further, there is a significant reduction in the association of intact pp125(FAK) with the cytoskeletal fraction, while pp125(FAK) cleavage fragments appear in the cytoplasm in SMC treated with degraded collagen fragments. Integrin-blocking studies indicate that integrin-mediated signals are involved in degraded collagen induction of pp125(FAK) cleavage. Thus, collagen fragments induce distinct integrin signals that lead to initiation of calpain-mediated cleavage of pp125(FAK), paxillin, and talin and dissolution of the focal adhesion complex.},
annote = {Intracelular signalling induced by the ECM may be mediated through the focal adhesion complex. Focal adhesions are sites of integrein-ECM adhesion. They consist of numerous signalling proteins and the cytoplasmic tail of beta integrins which serve as a physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton.

FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that localises to focal adhesions and may play an important role in the integration of signals from integrins and growth factors.

The ppFAK125 protein can be divided into 3 parts; an NH2-terminal integrin binding domain consisting of two proline-rich motifs and a focal adhesion targeting sequence required to association with other focal adhesion proteins (p130cas, paxillin, talin). ppFAK125 also contains sites of tyrosine phosphorylation involved in binding to the SH2 domains of PI3K and Grb2. Through these domains ppFAK125 recruits signalling molecules to the focal adhesion complex and transduces downstream signals derived from integrin-ECM interactions.},

abstract = {In a recently developed human breast cancer model, treatment of tumor cells in a 3-dimensional culture with inhibitory beta1-integrin antibody or its Fab fragments led to a striking morphological and functional reversion to a normal phenotype. A stimulatory beta1-integrin antibody proved to be ineffective. The newly formed reverted acini re-assembled a basement membrane and re-established E-cadherin-catenin complexes, and re-organized their cytoskeletons. At the same time they downregulated cyclin D1, upregulated p21(cip,wat-1), and stopped growing. Tumor cells treated with the same antibody and injected into nude mice had significantly reduced number and size of tumors in nude mice. The tissue distribution of other integrins was also normalized, suggesting the existence of intimate interactions between the different integrin pathways as well as adherens junctions. On the other hand, nonmalignant cells when treated with either alpha6 or beta4 function altering antibodies continued to grow, and had disorganized colony morphologies resembling the untreated tumor colonies. This shows a significant role of the alpha6/beta4 heterodimer in directing polarity and tissue structure. The observed phenotypes were reversible when the cells were disassociated and the antibodies removed. Our results illustrate that the extracellular matrix and its receptors dictate the phenotype of mammary epithelial cells, and thus in this model system the tissue phenotype is dominant over the cellular genotype.},

Yet cancer cell interaction with collagen I matrices is critical, particularly for the peritoneal metastatic route undertaken by several cancer types including ovarian. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity is important to enable cells to overcome the barrier constraints imposed by basement membranes and stromal matrices in vivo. Our objective was to compare matrices reconstituted from collagen I and Matrigel as representative barriers for ovarian cancer cell invasion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The requirement of MMP activity for ovarian cancer cell penetration of Matrigel and collagen matrices was assessed in 2D transwell and 3D spheroid culture systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The broad range MMP inhibitor GM6001 completely prevented cell perforation of polymerised collagen I-coated transwell membranes. In contrast, GM6001 decreased ES-2 cell penetration of Matrigel by only approximately 30{\%} and had no effect on HEY cell Matrigel penetration. In 3D culture, ovarian cancer cells grown as spheroids also migrated into surrounding Matrigel matrices despite MMP blockade. In contrast, MMP activity was required for invasion into 3D matrices of collagen I reconstituted from acid-soluble rat-tail collagen I, but not from pepsin-extracted collagen I (Vitrogen/Purecol), which lacks telopeptide regions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Matrigel does not form representative barriers to ovarian cancer cells in either 2D or 3D culture systems. Our findings support the use of collagen I rather than Matrigel as a matrix barrier for invasion studies to better approximate critical interactions and events associated with peritoneal metastasis.},

Analysis of 3D in vivo images, however, is very challenging. Today's best practice, manual annotation of select image events, generates arbitrarily sampled data distributions, which are unsuitable for reliable mechanistic inferences. Here, we present an integrated workflow for quantitative in vivo cell-cycle profiling. It combines image analysis and machine learning methods for automated 3D segmentation and cell-cycle state identification of individual cell-nuclei with widely varying morphologies embedded in complex tumor environments. We applied our workflow to quantify cell-cycle effects of three antimitotic cancer drugs over 8 d in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma xenografts in living mice using a data set of 38,000 cells and compared the induced phenotypes. In contrast to results with 2D culture, observed mitotic arrest was relatively low, suggesting involvement of additional mechanisms in their antitumor effect in vivo.},

- S, G2 and mitotic cells are green

Mixed fluorescent cells with non-fluorescent cell lines to decrease fluorescent cell density and increase accuracy.

Nuclei segmentation
-------------------------

- Difficult in 3D intravital images due to high cell density and variability in nuclei size, shape and appearance.

- Their solution couples marker-controlled watersheds with novel supervised hierachical learning based region-merging method.

- Nuclei were segmented without cell-cycle information

1. locally adaptive thresholding algorithm to obtain coarse foreground-background segmentation.
2. Detect seed points in nuclei using 3D extension of a scale-adaptive multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter, and used them as markers for a marker-controlled watershed algorithm to obtain an initial segmentation result.

- Intentionally over-segmented the nuclei, and then corrected this with a supervised hierachical learning based algorithm that finds all pairs of spatially adjacent regions and presents them to a discriminative two-class classification model based on image derived features. The pairs of the classifier recommends for merging are iteratively mergedd in decreased order of merge probability.

Automated cell-cycle state identification
--------------------------------------------------

- Developed a fully automated supervised classification scheme to identify the cell-cycle state of each detected cell on the basis of image-derived features extracted from the cell-cycle reporter.

- Built a 4-class model that associates a given cell with:
- G1
- late G1/early S
- S/G2
- mitosis

- Then built a coarser, more accurate, classification scheme on two-classes:
- interphase (G1 + late G1/early S + S/G2) versus mitosis
- G1 versus S + G2 + mitosis


Quantitative analysis of cancer drug effects in space and time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Used the workflow to track the effects of cancer therapeutics on cell-cycle progression.

- Analysed the single-cell dynamics of paclitaxel treatment

- An overall downward trend in cell density after treatment. Cell-cycle state quantification showed that mitotic cells cells accumulated after drug injection, peaking on day 2. Cell-cycle arrest was much more modest in the 3D assay compared to that of the 2D cultures.

Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA.

abstract = {Extracellular matrix interactions have essential roles in normal physiology and many pathological processes. Although the importance of extracellular matrix interactions in metastasis is well documented, systematic approaches to identify their roles in distinct stages of tumorigenesis have not been described. Here we report a novel-screening platform capable of measuring phenotypic responses to combinations of extracellular matrix molecules. Using a genetic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we measure the extracellular matrix-dependent adhesion of tumour-derived cells. Hierarchical clustering of the adhesion profiles differentiates metastatic cell lines from primary tumour lines. Furthermore, we uncovered that metastatic cells selectively associate with fibronectin when in combination with galectin-3, galectin-8 or laminin. We show that these molecules correlate with human disease and that their interactions are mediated in part by $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin. Thus, our platform allowed us to interrogate interactions between metastatic cells and their microenvironments, and identified extracellular matrix and integrin interactions that could serve as therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Tumor metastasis involves a progressive loss of tissue architecture and dissolution of structural boundaries between the epithelium and connective tissue. The basement membrane (BM), a specialized network of extracellular matrix proteins forms a barrier that physically restricts pre-invasive lesions such that they remain as local insults. The BM is not a static structure, but one that is constantly regenerated and remodeled in the adult organism. Matrix organization also regulates cell function. Thus alterations in the balance of synthesis, remodeling and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins may contribute to a loss of structural integrity. However, the de novo assembly and maintenance of the complex structural properties of in vivo basement membranes remain elusive. Here, this paper highlights the current understanding on the structural properties and the establishment of the BM, and discusses the potential role of self-generated forces in adult tissue remodeling and the maintenance of the BM as a malignancy suppressor.},

abstract = {Breast cancer remains a significant scientific, clinical and societal challenge. This gap analysis has reviewed and critically assessed enduring issues and new challenges emerging from recent research, and proposes strategies for translating solutions into practice. More than 100 internationally recognised specialist breast cancer scientists, clinicians and healthcare professionals collaborated to address nine thematic areas: genetics, epigenetics and epidemiology; molecular pathology and cell biology; hormonal influences and endocrine therapy; imaging, detection and screening; current/novel therapies and biomarkers; drug resistance; metastasis, angiogenesis, circulating tumour cells, cancer ‘stem' cells; risk and prevention; living with and managing breast cancer and its treatment. The groups developed summary papers through an iterative process which, following further appraisal from experts and patients, were melded into this summary account. The 10 major gaps identified were: (1) understanding the functions and contextual interactions of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal breast development and during malignant transformation; (2) how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight) and chemopreventive strategies; (3) the need for tailored screening approaches including clinically actionable tests; (4) enhancing knowledge of molecular drivers behind breast cancer subtypes, progression and metastasis; (5) understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity, dormancy, de novo or acquired resistance and how to target key nodes in these dynamic processes; (6) developing validated markers for chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity; (7) understanding the optimal duration, sequencing and rational combinations of treatment for improved personalised therapy; (8) validating multimodality imaging biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis and monitoring of responses in primary and metastatic disease; (9) developing interventions and support to improve the survivorship experience; (10) a continuing need for clinical material for translational research derived from normal breast, blood, primary, relapsed, metastatic and drug-resistant cancers with expert bioinformatics support to maximise its utility. The proposed infrastructural enablers include enhanced resources to support clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumour models; improved access to appropriate, fully annotated clinical samples; extended biomarker discovery, validation and standardisation; and facilitated cross-discipline working. With resources to conduct further high-quality targeted research focusing on the gaps identified, increased knowledge translating into improved clinical care should be achievable within five years.},

abstract = {Chemotherapy is one of the principal modes of treatment for cancer, but the effectiveness of chemotherapy is lim-ited by drug resistance. Resistance to chemotherapeutics can be divided into two broad categories: intrinsic or acquired. Intrinsic resistance indicates that before receiv-ing chemotherapy, resistance-mediating factors pre-exist in the bulk of tumour cells that make the therapy inef-fective. Acquired drug resistance can develop during treatment of tumours that were initially sensitive and can be caused by mutations arising during treatment, as well as through various other adaptive responses, such as increased expression of the therapeutic target and acti-vation of alternative compensatory signalling pathways 1 . Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that tumours can contain a high degree of molecular heterogeneity 2 , thus drug resistance can arise through therapy-induced selec-tion of a resistant minor subpopulation of cells that was present in the original tumour. The use of modern genomic, proteomic and functional analytical techniques has resulted in a substantial increase in our ability to identify novel genes and signalling net-works that are involved in determining the responsive-ness of tumours to a particular drug treatment. Moreover, the use of high-throughput techniques in combination with bioinformatics and systems biology approaches has aided the interrogation of clinical samples and allowed the identification of molecular signatures and genotypes that predict responses to certain drugs. In addition, such approaches can identify novel therapeutic targets for over-coming or bypassing drug resistance. A diverse range of molecular mechanisms have been implicated in drug resistance; these include increased rates of drug efflux, alterations in drug metabolism and mutation of drug targets},

Better functional knowledge of the complex intra- and intercellular signaling circuits underlying communication between the different cell types populating a tumor tissue and of the systemic and local factors that shape the tumor microenvironment is therefore imperative. Sophisticated 3D multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) systems provide an emerging tool to model the phenotypic and cellular heterogeneity as well as microenvironmental aspects of in vivo tumor growth. In this review we discuss the cellular, chemical and physical factors contributing to zonation and cellular crosstalk within tumor masses. On this basis, we further describe 3D cell culture technologies for growth of MCTS as advanced tools for exploring molecular tumor growth determinants and facilitating drug discovery efforts. We conclude with a synopsis on technological aspects for on-line analysis and post-processing of 3D MCTS models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, specifically disrupting the pro-tumorigenic TME is a challenging undertaking, as the TME has diverse capacities to induce both beneficial and adverse consequences for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, many studies have shown that the microenvironment is capable of normalizing tumor cells, suggesting that re-education of stromal cells, rather than targeted ablation per se, may be an effective strategy for treating cancer.

These proteins are expressed dynamically and their cellular functions are highly dependent upon cues from the local environment. Recent studies have shown an increasing appreciation of the key roles these ECM proteins play within the tumour microenvironment. Induced by either tumour cells or tumour stromal components, matricellular proteins initiate downstream signalling events that lead to proliferation, invasion, matrix remodelling and dissemination to pre-metastatic niches in other organs. In this review, we summarise and discuss the current knowledge of the diverse roles these proteins play within the microenvironment that influences tumour progression and potential for future therapies targeting the tumour microenvironment.},
annote = {Matricellular proteins: non-structural ECM proteins that modulate cell-matrix interactions and cell regulatory functions by different mechanisms.

These proteins exert their funcitons by either binding to cell surface receptors, or binding to other ECM proteins to form a scaffold that can trigger extracellular signalling pathways for upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and other growth factors.

Members of this family:
- osteopontin (OPN)
- periostin (POSTN)
- secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)
- tenascin C (TNC)

In cancer, overexpression of matricellular proteins by activated fibroblasts or malignant cells can potentiate pro-tumorigenic interactionsin the tumour microenvironment.

-------------------------------------------

POSTN is a secreted TGF-beta inducible protein that binds to several ECM proteins (collagen-I, integrins - activating PKB/Akt), shown an increase the metastatic potential, stimulates EMT, and increases cell survival in a number of cancer cell lines. 

TNC is modulated by beta-catenin, knock-down of TNC in breast cancer cell lines has shown to devrease cell migration in vitro, and also reduce formation of metastases in vivo.

OPN can induce cell motility and invasion, binds to a number of cellular receptors such as integrins, CD44. OPN is found upregulated in epithelial cancers, secreted into the ECM where is mediates cell-matrix interactions to initiate cell signalling via EGFR, c-MET, or induce cell proliferation and migration.

SPARC binds directly to components within the ECM such as collagen-I/III and integrein receptors (a4b4, b1 and b5). SPARC also binds directly to VEGF. SPARC is broadly anti-proliferative, de-adhesive and promotes cell-ECM interactions. SPARC overexpression in normal melanoma cells reduces E-cadherin expression and induces EMT through upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as Snail.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 AACR.In recent experiments on isogenetic cancer cell lines, it was observed that exposure to high doses of anticancer drugs can induce the emergence of a subpopulation of weakly proliferative and drug-tolerant cells, which display markers associated with stem cell-like cancer cells. After a period of time, some of the surviving cells were observed to change their phenotype to resume normal proliferation and eventually repopulate the sample. Furthermore, the drug-tolerant cells could be drug resensitized following drug washout. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism for the transient emergence of such drug tolerance. In this framework, we formulate an individual-based model and an integro-differential equation model of reversible phenotypic evolution in a cell population exposed to cytotoxic drugs. The outcomes of both models suggest that nongenetic instability, stress-induced adaptation, selection, and the interplay between these mechanisms can push an actively proliferating cell population to transition into a weakly proliferative and drug-tolerant state. Hence, the cell population experiences much less stress in the presence of the drugs and, in the long run, reacquires a proliferative phenotype, due to phenotypic fluctuations and selection pressure. These mechanisms can also reverse epigenetic drug tolerance following drug washout. Our study highlights how the transient appearance of the weakly proliferative and drug-tolerant cells is related to the use of high-dose therapy. Furthermore, we show how stem-like characteristics can act to stabilize the transient, weakly proliferative, and drug-tolerant subpopulation for a longer time window. Finally, using our models as in silico laboratories, we propose new testable hypotheses that could help uncover general principles underlying the emergence of cancer drug tolerance.},

abstract = {Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in the cross-talk and mediation of many signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis. Increased Src activity has been reported in many types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.},

Since their discovery nearly 20 years ago, Aurora kinases have been studied extensively in cell and cancer biology. Several early studies found that Aurora kinases are amplified and overexpressed at the transcript and protein level in various malignancies, including several types of leukemia. These discoveries and others provided a rationale for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases as leukemia therapies. The first generation of Aurora kinase inhibitors did not fare well in clinical trials, owing to poor efficacy and high toxicity. However, the creation of second-generation, highly selective Aurora kinase inhibitors has increased the enthusiasm for targeting these proteins in leukemia. This review will describe the functions of each Aurora kinase, summarize their involvement in leukemia and discuss inhibitor development and efficacy in leukemia clinical trials.},

abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in the use of phenotypic screens in drug discovery as an alternative to target-focused approaches. Given that oncology is currently the most active therapeutic area, and also one in which target-focused approaches have been particularly prominent in the past two decades, we investigated the contribution of phenotypic assays to oncology drug discovery by analysing the origins of all new small-molecule cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the past 15 years and those currently in clinical development. Although the majority of these drugs originated from target-based discovery, we identified a significant number whose discovery depended on phenotypic screening approaches. We postulate that the contribution of phenotypic screening to cancer drug discovery has been hampered by a reliance on 'classical' nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity and mitotic arrest, exacerbated by a paucity of mechanistically defined cellular models for therapeutically translatable cancer phenotypes. However, technical and biological advances that enable such mechanistically informed phenotypic models have the potential to empower phenotypic drug discovery in oncology.},

@article{Roskoski2015,
abstract = {The physiological Src proto-oncogene is a protein-tyrosine kinase that plays key roles in cell growth, division, migration, and survival signaling pathways. From the N- to C-terminus, Src contains a unique domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a protein-tyrosine kinase domain, and a regulatory tail. The chief phosphorylation sites of human Src include an activating pTyr419 that results from phosphorylation in the kinase domain by an adjacent Src molecule and an inhibitory pTyr530 in the regulatory tail that results from phosphorylation by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or Chk (Csk homologous kinase). The oncogenic Rous sarcoma viral protein lacks the equivalent of Tyr530 and is constitutively activated. Inactive Src is stabilized by SH2 and SH3 domains on the rear of the kinase domain where they form an immobilizing and inhibitory clamp. Protein kinases including Src contain hydrophobic regulatory and catalytic spines and collateral shell residues that are required to assemble the active enzyme. In the inactive enzyme, the regulatory spine contains a kink or a discontinuity with a structure that is incompatible with catalysis. The conversion of inactive to active Src is accompanied by electrostatic exchanges involving the breaking and making of distinct sets of kinase domain salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Src-catalyzed protein phosphorylation requires the participation of two Mg2+ions. Although nearly all protein kinases possess a common K/E/D/D signature, each enzyme exhibits its unique variations of the protein-kinase reaction template. Bosutinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib are Src/multikinase inhibitors that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and vandetanib is approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer. The Src and BCR-Abl inhibitors saracatinib and AZD0424, along with the previous four drugs, are in clinical trials for a variety of solid tumors including breast and lung cancers. Both ATP and targeted therapeutic Src protein kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and ponatinib make hydrophobic contacts with catalytic spine residues and form hydrogen bonds with hinge residues connecting the small and large kinase lobes.},

Here, we perform whole-genome methylation capture sequencing on small amounts of DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and matched normal samples. We identify dif- ferentially methylated regions (DMRs) enriched with promoters associated with transcription factor binding sites and DNA hypersensitive sites. Importantly, we stratify TNBCs into three distinct methylation clusters associated with better or worse prognosis and identify 17 DMRs that show a strong association with overall survival, including DMRs located in the Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) gene, bi-directional-promoter and antisense WT1-AS. Our data reveal that coordinated hypermethylation can occur in oestrogen receptor-negative disease, and that characterizing the epigenetic framework provides a potential signature to stratify TNBCs. Together, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of profiling the cancer methylome with limited archival tissue to identify regulatory regions associated with cancer.},

Through the generation of high-quality images, not only the specific target signal can be analyzed but also phenotypic changes of the whole cell are recorded. Yet analysis strategies for the exploration of high-content screening results, in a manner that is independent from predefined control phenotypes, are largely missing. The approach presented here is based on a well-established modeling technique, self-organizing maps (SOMs), which uses multiparametric results to group treatments that create similar morphological effects. This report describes a novel visualization of the SOM clustering by using an image of the cells from each node, with the most representative cell highlighted to deploy the phenotype described by each node. The approach has the potential to identify both expected hits and novel cellular phenotypes. Moreover, different chemotypes, which cause the same phenotypic effects, are identified, thus facilitating "scaffold hopping."},

Exogenous BCL11A overexpression promotes tumour formation, whereas its knockdown in TNBC cell lines suppresses their tumourigenic potential in xenograft models. In the DMBA-induced tumour model, Bcl11a deletion substantially decreases tumour formation, even in p53-null cells and inactivation of Bcl11a in established tumours causes their regression. At the cellular level, Bcl11a deletion causes a reduction in the number of mammary epithelial stem and progenitor cells. Thus, BCL11A has an important role in TNBC and normal mammary epithelial cells. This study highlights the importance of further investigation of BCL11A in TNBC-targeted therapies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated Na(+) channels (VGSCs) are heteromeric protein complexes containing pore-forming $\alpha$ subunits and smaller, non-pore-forming $\beta$ subunits. VGSCs are classically expressed in electrically excitable cells, e.g. neurons. VGSCs are also expressed in tumour cells, including breast cancer (BCa) cells, where they enhance cellular migration and invasion. However, despite extensive work defining in detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of VGSCs and their pro-invasive role in cancer cells, there has been a notable lack of clinically relevant in vivo data exploring their value as potential therapeutic targets. FINDINGS: We have previously reported that the VGSC-blocking antiepileptic drug phenytoin inhibits the migration and invasion of metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to establish whether VGSCs might be viable therapeutic targets by testing the effect of phenytoin on tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. We found that expression of Nav1.5, previously detected in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, was retained on cells in orthotopic xenografts. Treatment with phenytoin, at a dose equivalent to that used to treat epilepsy (60 mg/kg; daily), significantly reduced tumour growth, without affecting animal weight. Phenytoin also reduced cancer cell proliferation in vivo and invasion into surrounding mammary tissue. Finally, phenytoin significantly reduced metastasis to the liver, lungs and spleen.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing that phenytoin reduces breast tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. We propose that pharmacologically targeting VGSCs, by repurposing antiepileptic or antiarrhythmic drugs, should be further studied as a potentially novel anti-cancer therapy.},

For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches.

abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

@article{Donoho2000,
abstract = {The coming century is surely the century of data. A combination of blind faith and serious purpose makes our society invest massively in the collection and processing of data of all kinds, on scales unimaginable until recently. Hyperspectral Imagery, Internet Portals, Financial tick-by-tick data, and DNA Microarrays are just a few of the better-known sources, feeding data in torrential streams into scientific and business databases worldwide. In traditional statistical data analysis, we think of observations of instances of par-ticular phenomena (e.g. instance ↔ human being), these observations being a vector of values we measured on several variables (e.g. blood pressure, weight, height, ...). In traditional statistical methodology, we assumed many observations and a few, well-chosen variables. The trend today is towards more observations but even more so, to radically larger numbers of variables – voracious, automatic, systematic collection of hyper-informative detail about each observed instance. We are seeing examples where the observations gathered on individual instances are curves, or spectra, or images, or even movies, so that a single observation has dimensions in the thousands or billions, while there are only tens or hundreds of instances available for study. Classical methods are simply not designed to cope with this kind of explosive growth of dimensionality of the observation vector. We can say with complete confidence that in the coming cen-tury, high-dimensional data analysis will be a very significant activity, and completely new methods of high-dimensional data analysis will be developed; we just don't know what they are yet. Mathematicians are ideally prepared for appreciating the abstract issues involved in finding patterns in such high-dimensional data. Two of the most influential prin-ciples in the coming century will be principles originally discovered and cultivated by mathematicians: the blessings of dimensionality and the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality is a phrase used by several subfields in the mathematical sciences; I use it here to refer to the apparent intractability of systematically searching through a high-dimensional space, the apparent intractability of accurately approxi-mating a general high-dimensional function, the apparent intractability of integrating a high-dimensional function. The blessings of dimensionality are less widely noted, but they include the concen-tration of measure phenomenon (so-called in the geometry of Banach spaces), which means that certain random fluctuations are very well controlled in high dimensions and the success of asymptotic methods, used widely in mathematical statistics and statis-tical physics, which suggest that statements about very high-dimensional settings may be made where moderate dimensions would be too complicated. 1 There is a large body of interesting work going on in the mathematical sciences, both to attack the curse of dimensionality in specific ways, and to extend the benefits of dimensionality. I will mention work in high-dimensional approximation theory, in probability theory, and in mathematical statistics. I expect to see in the coming decades many further mathematical elaborations to our inventory of Blessings and Curses, and I expect such contributions to have a broad impact on society's ability to extract meaning from the massive datasets it has decided to compile. At the end of my talk, I will also draw on my personal research experiences. This suggest to me (1) ongoing developments in high-dimensional data analysis may lead mathematicians to study new problems in for example harmonic analysis; and (2) that many of the problems of low dimensional data analysis are unsolved and are similar to problems in harmonic analysis which have only recently been attacked, and for which only the merest beginnings have been made. Both fields can progress together. Dedication. To the Memory of John Wilder Tukey 1915-2000.},

abstract = {Through statistical analysis of datasets describing single cell shape following systematic gene depletion, we have found that the morphological landscapes explored by cells are composed of a small number of attractor states. We propose that the topology of these landscapes is in large part determined by cell-intrinsic factors, such as biophysical constraints on cytoskeletal organization, and reflects different stable signaling and/or transcriptional states. Cell-extrinsic factors act to determine how cells explore these landscapes, and the topology of the landscapes themselves. Informational stimuli primarily drive transitions between stable states by engaging signaling networks, while mechanical stimuli tune, or even radically alter, the topology of these landscapes. As environments fluctuate, the topology of morphological landscapes explored by cells dynamically adapts to these fluctuations. Finally we hypothesize how complex cellular and tissue morphologies can be generated from a limited number of simple cell shapes.},

abstract = {Cell-based high-content screens are increasingly used to discover bioactive small molecules. However, identifying the mechanism of action of the selected compounds is a major bottleneck. Here we describe a protocol consisting of experimental and computational steps to identify the cellular pathways modulated by chemicals, and their mechanism of action. The multiparametric profiles from a 'query' chemical screen are used as constraints to select genes with similar profiles from a 'reference' genetic screen. In our case, the query screen is the intracellular survival of mycobacteria and the reference is a genome-wide RNAi screen of endocytosis. The two disparate screens are bridged by an 'intermediate' chemical screen of endocytosis, so that the similarity in the multiparametric profiles between the chemical and the genetic perturbations can generate a testable hypothesis of the cellular pathways modulated by the chemicals. This approach is not assay specific, but it can be broadly applied to various quantitative, multiparametric data sets. Generation of the query system takes 3-6 weeks, and data analysis and integration with the reference data set takes an 3 additional weeks.},

@article{Mekler2014,
abstract = {Motivation: One of the important aspects of the data classification problem lies in making the most appropriate selection of features. The set of variables should be small and, at the same time, should provide reliable discrimination of the classes. The method for the discriminating power evaluation that enables a comparison between different sets of variables will be useful in the search for the set of variables. Results: A new approach to feature selection is presented. Two methods of evaluation of the data discriminating power of a feature set are suggested. Both of the methods implement self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the newly introduced exponents of the degree of data clusterization on the SOM. The first method is based on the comparison of intraclass and interclass distances on the map. Another method concerns the evaluation of the relative number of best matching unit's (BMUs) nearest neighbors of the same class. Both methods make it possible to evaluate the discriminating power of a feature set in cases when this set provides nonlinear discrimination of the classes.

@article{Sisan2012,
abstract = {We develop a potential landscape approach to quantitatively describe experimental data from a fibroblast cell line that exhibits a wide range of GFP expression levels under the control of the promoter for tenascin-C. Time-lapse live-cell microscopy provides data about short-term fluctuations in promoter activity, and flow cytometry measurements provide data about the long-term kinetics, because isolated subpopulations of cells relax from a relatively narrow distribution of GFP expression back to the original broad distribution of responses. The landscape is obtained from the steady state distribution of GFP expression and connected to a potential-like function using a stochastic differential equation description (Langevin/Fokker-Planck). The range of cell states is constrained by a force that is proportional to the gradient of the potential, and biochemical noise causes movement of cells within the landscape. Analyzing the mean square displacement of GFP intensity changes in live cells indicates that these fluctuations are described by a single diffusion constant in log GFP space. This finding allows application of the Kramers' model to calculate rates of switching between two attractor states and enables an accurate simulation of the dynamics of relaxation back to the steady state with no adjustable parameters. With this approach, it is possible to use the steady state distribution of phenotypes and a quantitative description of the short-term fluctuations in individual cells to accurately predict the rates at which different phenotypes will arise from an isolated subpopulation of cells.},

@article{Haney2014,
abstract = {When investigators monitor effects on a population of cells following a perturbation, these events rarely occur in a classical normal (or Gaussian) distribution. A normal distribution is, however, explicitly assumed for events within a single well, in which mean values per well are used as an assay metric and, in general, measures of assay robustness, such as the Z' score and the V factor. Such analysis is not possible for many technologies; however, high-content screening (HCS) measures events of individual cells, which are averaged over the well. These individual cell-level measurements may be analyzed separately. This study quantifies the extent of nonnormality in experimental samples and their effects on determining the EC50 of a test compound and the assay robustness statistics. The results, based on five sets of publicly available data, indicate that the Z' or V-factor score can be improved by as much as 0.44 more than standard calculations, and the EC50 of a dose-response curve can be lowered by as much as fivefold when nonparametric methods are used, but not all data sets show a significant improvement. The effect on analysis depends in part on whether the greatest shift from normality occurs in the upper or lower range of the dose-response curve.},

Central to that goal is the determination of the function of each protein that is present in a given cell type, and determining a protein's location within cells is critical to understanding its function. As large amounts of data become available from genome-wide determination of protein subcellular location, automated approaches to categorizing and comparing location patterns are urgently needed. Since sub- cellular location is most often determined using ﬂuorescence microscopy, we have developed automated systems for interpreting the resulting images. We report here improved numeric features for describing such images that are fairly robust to image intensity binning and spatial resolution. We validate these features by using them to train neural networks that accurately recognize all major subcellular patterns with an accuracy higher than any previously reported. Having validated the features by using them for classiﬁcation, we also demonstrate using them to create Subcellular Location Trees that group similar proteins and provide a systematic framework for describing subcellular location.},

abstract = {Automated, image based high-content screening is a fundamental tool for discovery in biological science. Modern robotic fluorescence microscopes are able to capture thousands of images from massively parallel experiments such as RNA interference (RNAi) or small-molecule screens. As such, efficient computational methods are required for automatic cellular phenotype identification capable of dealing with large image data sets. In this paper we investigated an efficient method for the extraction of quantitative features from images by combining second order statistics, or Haralick features, with curvelet transform. A random subspace based classifier ensemble with multiple layer perceptron (MLP) as the base classifier was then exploited for classification. Haralick features estimate image properties related to second-order statistics based on the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), which has been extensively used for various image processing applications. The curvelet transform has a more sparse representation of the image than wavelet, thus offering a description with higher time frequency resolution and high degree of directionality and anisotropy, which is particularly appropriate for many images rich with edges and curves. A combined feature description from Haralick feature and curvelet transform can further increase the accuracy of classification by taking their complementary information. We then investigate the applicability of the random subspace (RS) ensemble method for phenotype classification based on microscopy images. A base classifier is trained with a RS sampled subset of the original feature set and the ensemble assigns a class label by majority voting.},

abstract = {High-content screening (HCS) is a powerful tool for drug discovery being capable of measuring cellular responses to chemical disturbance in a high-throughput manner. HCS provides an image-based readout of cellular phenotypes, including features such as shape, intensity, or texture in a highly multiplexed and quantitative manner. The corresponding feature vectors can be used to characterize phenotypes and are thus defined as HCS fingerprints. Systematic analyses of HCS fingerprints allow for objective computational comparisons of cellular responses. Such comparisons therefore facilitate the detection of different compounds with different phenotypic outcomes from high-throughput HCS campaigns. Feature selection methods and similarity measures, as a basis for phenotype identification and clustering, are critical for the quality of such computational analyses. We systematically evaluated 16 different similarity measures in combination with linear and nonlinear feature selection methods for their potential to capture biologically relevant image features. Nonlinear correlation-based similarity measures such as Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's $\rho$ perform well in most evaluation scenarios, outperforming other frequently used metrics (such as the Euclidian distance). We also present four novel modifications of the connectivity map similarity that surpass the original version, in our experiments. This study provides a basis for generic phenotypic analysis in future HCS campaigns.},

Harnessing this complexity requires integration of all the different parameters that can be measured rather than just monitoring a single dimension as is commonly used. Although some of the methods used to combine multiple measurements, such as principal component analysis, are commonly used for microarray analysis, biologists are not yet using many of the tools that have been developed in other fields to address such issues. Visualization of multiparametric data sets is one of the major challenges in this field, and a depiction of the results in a manner that can be readily interpreted is essential. This article describes a number of assay systems being used to generate such data sets en masse, and the methods being applied to their visualization and analysis.

abstract = {Methods for numerical description and subsequent classification of cellular protein localization patterns are described. Images representing the localization patterns of 4 proteins and DNA were obtained using fluorescence microscopy and divided into distinct training and test sets. The images were processed to remove out-of-focus and background fluorescence and 2 sets of numeric features were generated: Zernike moments and Haralick texture features. These feature sets were used as inputs to either a classification tree or a neural network. Classifier performance (the average percent of each type of image correctly classified) on previously unseen images ranged from 63{\%} for a classification tree using Zernike moments to 88{\%} for a backpropagation neural network using a combination of features from the 2 feature sets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying pattern recognition methods to subcellular localization patterns, enabling sets of previously unseen images from a single class to be classified with an expected accuracy greater than 99{\%}. This will provide not only a new automated way to describe proteins, based on localization rather than sequence, but also has potential application in the automation of microscope functions and in the field of gene discovery.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel image analysis methodology for automatically distinguishing low and high grades of breast cancer from digitized histopathology. A set of over 3,400 image features, including textural and nuclear architecture based features, are extracted from a database of 48 breast biopsy tissue studies (30 cancerous and 18 benign images). Spectral clustering is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used (1) to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous images, and (2) to distinguish between images containing low and high grades of cancer. Classification is repeated using different subsets of features to compare their performance. The system achieves a 95.8{\%} accuracy in distinguishing cancer from non-cancer using texture-based characteristics (Gabor filter features), and 93.3{\%} accuracy in distinguishing high from low grades of cancer using architectural features. In addition, we investigate the underlying main-fold structure on which the different grades of breast cancer lie as revealed through spectral clustering. The manifold shows a smooth spatial transition from low to high grade breast cancer.},

abstract = { This article reviews several techniques from machine learning that can be used to study the problem of identifying a small number of features, from among tens of thousands of measured features, that can accurately predict a drug response. Prediction problems are divided into two categories: sparse classification and sparse regression. In classification, the clinical parameter to be predicted is binary, whereas in regression, the parameter is a real number. Well-known methods for both classes of problems are briefly discussed. These include the SVM (support vector machine) for classification and various algorithms such as ridge regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and EN (elastic net) for regression. In addition, several well-established methods that do not directly fall into machine learning theory are also reviewed, including neural networks, PAM (pattern analysis for microarrays), SAM (significance analysis for microarrays), GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis), and k-means clustering. Several references indicative of the application of these methods to cancer biology are discussed. },

abstract = {Image analysis algorithms are often highly parameterized and much human input is needed to optimize parameter settings. This incurs a time cost of up to several days. We analyze and characterize the conventional parameter optimization process for image analysis and formulate user requirements. With this as input, we propose a change in paradigm by optimizing parameters based on parameter sampling and interactive visual exploration. To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step - initialization of sampling - and the last step - visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler - a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values. User-defined areas of interest are presented in a structured way that includes image-based output and a novel layout algorithm. To find optimal parameter settings, users can tag high- and low-quality results to refine their search. We include two case studies to illustrate the utility of this approach.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Metastasis is responsible for the greatest number of cancer deaths. Metastatic disease, or the movement of cancer cells from one site to another, is a complex process requiring dramatic remodelling of the cell cytoskeleton. The various components of the cytoskeleton, actin (microfilaments), microtubules (MTs) and intermediate filaments, are highly integrated and their functions are well orchestrated in normal cells. In contrast, mutations and abnormal expression of cytoskeletal and cytoskeletal-associated proteins play an important role in the ability of cancer cells to resist chemotherapy and metastasize. Studies on the role of actin and its interacting partners have highlighted key signalling pathways, such as the Rho GTPases, and downstream effector proteins that, through the cytoskeleton, mediate tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis. An emerging role for MTs in tumour cell metastasis is being unravelled and there is increasing interest in the crosstalk between key MT interacting proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, which may provide novel treatment avenues for metastatic disease. Improved understanding of how the cytoskeleton and its interacting partners influence tumour cell migration and metastasis has led to the development of novel therapeutics against aggressive and metastatic disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Cytoskeleton, Extracellular Matrix, Cell Migration, Wound Healing and Related Topics.

abstract = {Adhesion of tumor cells to host cell layers and subsequent transcellular migration are pivotal steps in cancer invasion and metastasis. The small GTPase Rho controls cell adhesion and motility through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulation of actomyosin contractility. Cultured rat MM1 hepatoma cells migrate through a mesothelial cell monolayer in vitro in a serum-dependent, Rho-mediated manners. Among several proteins isolated as putative target molecules of Rho, the ROCK (ROK) family of Rho-associated serine-threonine protein kinases are thought to participate in the induction of focal adhesions and stress fibers in cultured cells, and to mediate calcium sensitization of smooth muscle contraction by enhancing phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin. Transfection of MM1 cells with cDNA encoding a dominant active mutant of ROCK conferred invasive activity independently of serum and Rho. In contrast, expression of a dominant negative, kinase-defective ROCK mutant substantially attenuated the invasive phenotype. A specific ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) blocked both Rho-mediated activation of actomyosin and invasive activity of these cells. Furthermore, continuous delivery of this inhibitor using osmotic pumps considerably reduced the dissemination of MM1 cells implanted into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic rats. These results indicate that ROCK plays an essential part in tumor cell invasion, and demonstrate its potential as a therapeutic target for the prevention of cancer invasion and metastasis.},

abstract = {Rho, a Ras homologue of small GTPase, is present from yeast to mammals. It shuttles between the active GTP-bound form and the inactive GDP-bound form and works as a switch in stimulus-evoked cell adhesion and motility, enhancement of contractile responses, and cytokinesis. In these actions, Rho directs the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at a specific time and at a specific site in the cell. It also activates serum response factor possibly via a kinase cascade and mediates a growth signal to nuclei. Two signalling processes are known to lead to Rho activation: one is activation of certain types of G-protein-coupled receptors such as lysophosphatidic acid receptor, and the other is activation of other small GTPases including Ras, CDC42, and Rac. Molecules catalyzing the GDP-GTP exchange of Rho, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEF), and those catalyzing the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis, Rho GTPase activating proteins (Rho GAP), were identified as Dbl- and Bcr-containing molecules, respectively. In addition, a molecule inhibiting guanine nucleotide exchange of Rho, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI), was isolated and characterized. More recently, putative Rho targets possibly mediating various Rho actions have been identified by their selective interaction with GTP-bound Rho. They include lipid kinases such as phosphatidyl-inositol-5-kinase and protein serine/threonine kinases such as PKN and p160ROCK. A model of the molecular mechanism of action of Rho constructed on the basis of these findings is presented. There are, however, still many unclarified links between cell stimulation, Rho activation and final Rho actions.},

This study examined the inhibition mechanism and profile of actions of Y-27632 and a related compound, Y-30141 [(+)-(R)-trans- 4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(1H-pyrrolo[2, 3-b]pyridin-4-yl)cyclohexan-ecarboxamide dihydrochloride]. Y-27632 and Y-30141 inhibited the kinase activity of both ROCK-I and ROCK-II in vitro, and this inhibition was reversed by ATP in a competitive manner. This suggests that these compounds inhibit the kinases by binding to the catalytic site. Their affinities for ROCK kinases as determined by K(i) values were at least 20 to 30 times higher than those for two other Rho effector kinases, citron kinase and protein kinase PKN. [(3)H]Y-30141 was taken up by cells in a temperature- and time-dependent and saturable manner, and this uptake was competed with unlabeled Y-27632. No concentrated accumulation was found, suggesting that the uptake is a carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion. Y-27632 abolished stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells at 10 microM, but the G(1)-S phase transition of the cell cycle and cytokinesis were little affected at this concentration. Y-30141 was 10 times more potent than Y-27632 in inhibiting the kinase activity and stress fiber formation, and it caused significant delay in the G(1)-S transition and inhibition of cytokinesis at 10 microM.},

Animal cells move by crawling and the driving force is derived primarily from the coordinated assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. The small GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate the organization of actin filaments and we have analyzed their contributions to the movement of primary embryo fibroblasts in an in vitro wound healing assay. Rac is essential for the protrusion of lamellipodia and for forward movement. Cdc42 is required to maintain cell polarity, which includes the localization of lamellipodial activity to the leading edge and the reorientation of the Golgi apparatus in the direction of movement. Rho is required to maintain cell adhesion during movement, but stress fibers and focal adhesions are not required. Finally, Ras regulates focal adhesion and stress fiber turnover and this is essential for cell movement. We conclude that the signal transduction pathways controlled by the four small GTPases, Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and Ras, cooperate to promote cell movement.},

abstract = {A great deal of research has focused on al- gorithms for learning features from unla- beled data. Indeed, much progress has been made on benchmark datasets like NORB and CIFAR by employing increasingly complex unsupervised learning algorithms and deep models. In this paper, however, we show that several simple factors, such as the number of hidden nodes in the model, may be more im- portant to achieving high performance than the learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Specifically, we will apply several off- the-shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse auto-encoders, sparse RBMs, K-means clus- tering, and Gaussian mixtures) to CIFAR, NORB, and STL datasets using only single- layer networks. We then present a detailed analysis of the effect of changes in the model setup: the receptive field size, number of hid- den nodes (features), the step-size (“stride”) between extracted features, and the effect of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes and dense fea- ture extraction are critical to achieving high performance—so critical, in fact, that when these parameters are pushed to their limits, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a sin- gle layer of features. More surprisingly, our best performance is based on K-means clus- tering, which is extremely fast, has no hyper- parameters to tune beyond the model struc- ture itself, and is very easy to implement. De- spite the simplicity of our system, we achieve accuracy beyond all previously published re- sults on the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets (79.6{\%} and 97.2{\%} respectively).},

abstract = {Epithelium-to-mesenchyme transitions (EMTs) are characterized by morphological and behavioral changes in cells. During an EMT, E-cadherin is downregulated while N-cadherin is upregulated. The goal of this study was to understand the role cadherin switching plays in EMT using a classical model system: transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-mediated EMT in mammary epithelial cells. We showed that stress fibers and focal adhesions are increased, and cell-cell junctions are decreased in response to TGF-beta1. Moreover, these changes were reversible upon removal of TGF-beta1. Downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin were both transcriptional. Neither experimental knockdown nor experimental overexpression of N-cadherin interfered with the morphological changes. In addition, the morphological changes associated with EMT preceded the downregulation of E-cadherin. Interestingly, TGF-beta1-induced motility in N-cadherin-knockdown cells was significantly reduced. Together, these data suggest that cadherin switching is necessary for increased motility but is not required for the morphological changes that accompany EMT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is critical to understanding how that protein works in a cell. This location is frequently determined by the interpretation of fluorescence microscope images. In recent years, automated systems have been developed for consistent and objective interpretation of such images so that the protein pattern in a single cell can be assigned to a known location category. While these systems perform with nearly perfect accuracy for single cell images of all major subcellular structures, their ability to distinguish subpatterns of an organelle (such as two Golgi proteins) is not perfect. Our goal in the work described here was to improve the ability of an automated system to decide which of two similar patterns is present in a field of cells by considering more than one cell at a time. Since cells displaying the same location pattern are often clustered together, considering multiple cells may be expected to improve discrimination between similar patterns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We describe how to take advantage of information on experimental conditions to construct a graphical representation for multiple cells in a field. Assuming that a field is composed of a small number of classes, the classification accuracy can be improved by allowing the computed probability of each pattern for each cell to be influenced by the probabilities of its neighboring cells in the model. We describe a novel way to allow this influence to occur, in which we adjust the prior probabilities of each class to reflect the patterns that are present. When this graphical model approach is used on synthetic multi-cell images in which the true class of each cell is known, we observe that the ability to distinguish similar classes is improved without suffering any degradation in ability to distinguish dissimilar classes. The computational complexity of the method is sufficiently low that improved assignments of classes can be obtained for fields of twelve cells in under 0.04 second on a 1600 megahertz processor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that graphical models can be used to improve the accuracy of classification of subcellular patterns in multi-cell fluorescence microscope images. We also describe a novel algorithm for inferring classes from a graphical model. The performance and speed suggest that the method will be particularly valuable for analysis of images from high-throughput microscopy. We also anticipate that it will be useful for analyzing the mixtures of cell types typically present in images of tissues. Lastly, we anticipate that the method can be generalized to other problems.},

This study analyzes 258 proteins in 14 different cancer tissues and their corresponding normal tissues using images provided by the tissue microarray collection of the Human Protein Atlas. Using texture features automatically extracted from the tissue images, 14 machine classifiers were trained to recognize the patterns of eight major organelles in each tissue. For each tissue-protein combination, the results of the classifier for normal and cancerous tissues were compared. Eleven proteins were identified as showing differences in location; these proteins may have potential as biomarkers.},

abstract = {Motivation: Assessment of protein subcellular location is crucial to proteomics efforts since localization information provides a context for a protein's sequence, structure, and function. The work described below is the first to address the subcellular localization of proteins in a quantitative, comprehensive manner. Results: Images for ten different subcellular patterns (including all major organelles) were collected using fluorescence microscopy. The patterns were described using a variety of numeric features, including Zernike moments, Haralick texture features, and a set of new features developed specifically for this purpose. To test the usefulness of these features, they were used to train a neural network classifier. The classifier was able to correctly recognize an average of 83{\%} of previously unseen cells showing one of the ten patterns. The same classifier was then used to recognize previously unseen sets of homogeneously prepared cells with 98{\%} accuracy. Availability: Algorithms were implemented using the commercial products Matlab, S-Plus, and SAS, as well as some functions written in C.

abstract = {Metastasis of tumor cells is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a process whereby epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire new features of mesenchyme. EMT has been reported to be induced by transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1), but its mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we performed a study to investigate whether PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathways involved in EMT in the human lung cancer A549 cells. The results showed that after treated with TGF-$\beta$1 for 48 h, A549 cells displayed more fibroblast-like shape, lost epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Fibronectin. Moreover, TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT after 48 h was accompanied by increased of cell migration and change of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, EMT was reversed by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, which suggested that A549 cells under stimulation of TGF-$\beta$1 undergo a switch into mesenchymal cells and PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathways serve to regulate TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT of A549 cells.},

abstract = {The molecular pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, is complex and not fully understood. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) plays a critical role in many fibrotic disorders, including DN. In this study, we report protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation as a downstream event contributing to the pathophysiology of DN. We investigated the potential of PKB/Akt to mediate the profibrotic bioactions of TGF-beta1 in kidney. Treatment of normal rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK52E) with TGF-beta1 resulted in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and PKB/Akt as evidenced by increased Ser473 phosphorylation and GSK-3beta phosphorylation. TGF-beta1 also stimulated increased Smad3 phosphorylation in these cells, a response that was insensitive to inhibition of PI3K or PKB/Akt. NRK52E cells displayed a loss of zona occludins 1 and E-cadherin and a gain in vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, consistent with the fibrotic actions of TGF-beta1. These effects were blocked with inhibitors of PI3K and PKB/Akt. Furthermore, overexpression of PTEN, the lipid phosphatase regulator of PKB/Akt activation, inhibited TGF-beta1-induced PKB/Akt activation. Interestingly, in the Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes, we also detected increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its downstream target, GSK-3beta, in the tubules, relative to that in control Wistar rats. Elevated Smad3 phosphorylation was also detected in kidney extracts from Goto-Kakizaki rats with chronic diabetes. Together, these data suggest that TGF-beta1-mediated PKB/Akt activation may be important in renal fibrosis during diabetic nephropathy.},

Although the Src family kinases (SFKs) are activated in various types of cancers, the exact mechanisms through which they contribute to the progression of individual tumors remain to be defined. The activation of Src in human cancers may occur through a variety of mechanisms that include domain interaction and structural remodeling in response to various activators or upstream kinases and phosphatastes. Because of Src's prominent roles in invasion and tumor progression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and the development of metastasis, Src is a promising target for cancer therapy. Several small molecule inhibitors of Src are currently being investigated in clinical trials. In this article, we will summarize the mechanisms regulating Src kinase activity in normal and cancer cells and discuss the status of Src inhibitor development against various types of cancers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our discovery of several informative kinases with a previously uncharacterized role in cell migration (such as Mst and Taok family of MAPK kinases in mesenchymal cells) may represent novel targets that warrant further investigation.

abstract = {Large-scale analysis of cellular response to anticancer drugs typically focuses on variation in potency (half-maximum inhibitory concentration, (IC50)), assuming that it is the most important difference between effective and ineffective drugs or sensitive and resistant cells. We took a multiparametric approach involving analysis of the slope of the dose-response curve, the area under the curve and the maximum effect (Emax). We found that some of these parameters vary systematically with cell line and others with drug class. For cell-cycle inhibitors, Emax often but not always correlated with cell proliferation rate. For drugs targeting the Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway, dose-response curves were unusually shallow. Classical pharmacology has no ready explanation for this phenomenon, but single-cell analysis showed that it correlated with significant and heritable cell-to-cell variability in the extent of target inhibition. We conclude that parameters other than potency should be considered in the comparative analysis of drug response, particularly at clinically relevant concentrations near and above the IC50.},

abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event in the progression toward cancer metastasis. The intermediate filament protein vimentin is an important marker of EMT and a requisite regulator of mesenchymal cell migration. However, it is not known how vimentin functionally contributes to cancer cell invasion. Here, we report that ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Ras-V12G and Slug induces vimentin expression and migration in pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Conversely, vimentin expression is necessary for Slug- or H-Ras-V12G-induced EMT-associated migration. Furthermore, silencing of vimentin in breast epithelial cells results in specific changes in invasiveness-related gene expression including upregulation of RAB25 (small GTPase Rab25) and downregulation of AXL (receptor tyrosine kinase Axl), PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase) and ITGB4 (integrin $\beta$4-subunit). Importantly, gene expression profiling analyses reveal that vimentin expression correlates positively/negatively with these genes also in multiple breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient samples. Focusing on the tyrosine kinase Axl, we show that induction of vimentin by EMT is associated with upregulation of Axl expression and that Axl enhances the migratory activity of pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Using null and knock-down cells and overexpression models, we also show that regulation of breast cancer cell migration in two- and three-dimensional matrices by vimentin is Axl- dependent and that Axl functionally contributes to lung extravasation of breast cancer cells in mice. In conclusion, our data show that vimentin functionally contributes to EMT and is required for induction of Axl expression. Moreover, these results provide a molecular explanation for vimentin-dependent cancer cell migration during EMT by identifying Axl as a key proximal component in this process.},

abstract = {The lack of three-dimensional (3-D) high-throughput (HT) screening assays designed to identify anti-cancer invasion drugs is a major hurdle in reducing cancer-related mortality, with the key challenge being assay standardization. Presented is the development of a novel 3-D invasion assay with HT potential that involves surrounding cell-collagen spheres within collagen to create a 3-D environment through which cells can invade. Standardization was achieved by designing a tooled 96-well plate to create a precisely designated location for the cell-collagen spheres and by using dialdehyde dextran to inhibit collagen contraction, maintaining uniform size and shape. This permits automated readout for determination of the effect of inhibitory compounds on cancer cell invasion. Sensitivity was demonstrated by the ability to distinguish varying levels of invasiveness of cancer cell lines, and robustness was determined by calculating the Z-factor. A Z-factor of 0.65 was obtained by comparing the effects of DMSO and anti-$\beta$1-integrin antibody, an inhibitory reagent, on the invasion of Du145 cancer cells, suggesting this novel assay is suitable for large scale drug discovery. As proof of principle, the NCI Diversity Compound Library was screened against human invasive cancer cells. Nine compounds exhibiting high potency and low toxicity were identified, including DX-52-1, a compound previously reported to inhibit cell migration, a critical determinant of cancer invasion. The results indicate that this innovative HT platform is a simple, precise, and easy to replicate 3-D invasion assay for anti-cancer drug discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular plasticity confers cancer cells the ability to adapt to microenvironmental changes, a fundamental requirement for tumour progression and metastasis. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transcriptional programme associated with increased cell motility and stemness. Besides EMT, the mesenchymal to amoeboid transition (MAT) has been described during tumour progression but to date, little is known about its transcriptional control and involvement in stemness. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate (i) the transcriptional profile associated with the MAT programme and (ii) to study whether MAT acquisition in melanoma cancer cells correlates with clonogenic potential to promote tumour growth.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: By using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified four different treatments able to induce MAT in melanoma cells: EphA2 overexpression, Rac1 functional inhibition using its RacN17 dominant negative mutant, stimulation with Ilomastat or treatment with the RhoA activator Calpeptin. First, gene expression profiling identified the transcriptional pathways associated with MAT, independently of the stimulus that induces the MAT programme. Notably, gene sets associated with the repression of mesenchymal traits, decrease in the secretion of extracellular matrix components as well as increase of cellular stemness positively correlate with MAT. Second, the link between MAT and stemness has been investigated in vitro by analysing stemness markers and clonogenic potential of melanoma cells undergoing MAT. Finally, the link between MAT inducing treatments and tumour initiating capability has been validated in vivo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that MAT programme in melanoma is characterised by increased stemness and clonogenic features of cancer cells, thus sustaining tumour progression. Furthermore, these data suggest that stemness is not an exclusive feature of cells undergoing EMT, but more generally is associated with an increase in cellular plasticity of cancer cells.},

Our high-throughput screens led to frequent identification of the genes encoding the enzymes engaged in histone lysine methylation. Histone methylation can positively or negatively impact on gene transcription, and then fulfill important roles in developmental control and cell-fate decisions. A tremendous amount of progress has accelerated the characterization of histone methylations and the enzymes that regulate them. Deregulation of these histone methyl-modifying enzymes has been increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer in the last few years. However, in most cases, we have only limited understanding for the molecular mechanisms by which these enzymes contribute to cancer development and progression. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding some of the best-validated examples of histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases associated with oncogenesis and discuss their potential mechanisms of action.},

These effects occur via chemical structural interactions with epigenetic enzymes, through interactions with DNA repair mechanisms. Computational predictions indicate that one-twentieth of all drugs might potentially interact with human histone deacetylase, which was prospectively experimentally verified for the compound with the highest predicted interaction probability. These epigenetic effects add to wanted and unwanted drug effects, contributing to mechanisms of drug resistance or disease-related and unrelated phenotypes.

abstract = {While it has been established that a number of microenvironment components can affect the likelihood of metastasis, the link between microenvironment and tumor cell phenotypes is poorly understood. Here we have examined microenvironment control over two different tumor cell motility phenotypes required for metastasis. By high-resolution multiphoton microscopy of mammary carcinoma in mice, we detected two phenotypes of motile tumor cells, different in locomotion speed. Only slower tumor cells exhibited protrusions with molecular, morphological, and functional characteristics associated with invadopodia. Each region in the primary tumor exhibited either fast- or slow-locomotion. To understand how the tumor microenvironment controls invadopodium formation and tumor cell locomotion, we systematically analyzed components of the microenvironment previously associated with cell invasion and migration. No single microenvironmental property was able to predict the locations of tumor cell phenotypes in the tumor if used in isolation or combined linearly. To solve this, we utilized the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify phenotypes in a nonlinear fashion. This approach identified conditions that promoted either motility phenotype. We then demonstrated that varying one of the conditions may change tumor cell behavior only in a context-dependent manner. In addition, to establish the link between phenotypes and cell fates, we photoconverted and monitored the fate of tumor cells in different microenvironments, finding that only tumor cells in the invadopodium-rich microenvironments degraded extracellular matrix (ECM) and disseminated. The number of invadopodia positively correlated with degradation, while the inhibiting metalloproteases eliminated degradation and lung metastasis, consistent with a direct link among invadopodia, ECM degradation, and metastasis. We have detected and characterized two phenotypes of motile tumor cells in vivo, which occurred in spatially distinct microenvironments of primary tumors. We show how machine-learning analysis can classify heterogeneous microenvironments in vivo to enable prediction of motility phenotypes and tumor cell fate. The ability to predict the locations of tumor cell behavior leading to metastasis in breast cancer models may lead towards understanding the heterogeneity of response to treatment.},

Among the compounds tested, the indoline derivatives, generally, produced a higher cytotoxic effect compared to the morpholine derivatives, in osteosarcoma cells. Specifically, new indoline derivative N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl(4′-methylphenyl)methyl)indoline exhibited effective cytotoxic activity, with an IC50 of ∼74 $\mu$M. The same molecule induced cell death by apoptosis and inhibited migration of the cells. Further, analysis of mitochondrial calcium levels revealed the existence of calcium dependent cell death mechanisms in different cell types.

GBMs contain cells with molecular and cellular characteristics of neural stem cells that drive tumour growth. Here we compare responses of human glioblastoma-derived neural stem (GNS) cells and genetically normal neural stem (NS) cells to a panel of 160 small molecule kinase inhibitors. We used live-cell imaging and high content image analysis tools and identified JNJ-10198409 (J101) as an agent that induces mitotic arrest at prometaphase in GNS cells but not NS cells. Antibody microarrays and kinase profiling suggested that J101 responses are triggered by suppression of the active phosphorylated form of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (phospho T210), with resultant spindle defects and arrest at prometaphase. We found that potent and specific Plk1 inhibitors already in clinical development (BI 2536, BI 6727 and GSK 461364) phenocopied J101 and were selective against GNS cells. Using a porcine brain endothelial cell blood-brain barrier model we also observed that these compounds exhibited greater blood-brain barrier permeability in vitro than J101. Our analysis of mouse mutant NS cells (INK4a/ARF(-/-), or p53(-/-)), as well as the acute genetic deletion of p53 from a conditional p53 floxed NS cell line, suggests that the sensitivity of GNS cells to BI 2536 or J101 may be explained by the lack of a p53-mediated compensatory pathway. Together these data indicate that GBM stem cells are acutely susceptible to proliferative disruption by Plk1 inhibitors and that such agents may have immediate therapeutic value.},

abstract = {Computational methods for image-based profiling are under active development, but their success hinges on assays that can capture a wide range of phenotypes. We have developed a multiplex cytological profiling assay that "paints the cell" with as many fluorescent markers as possible without compromising our ability to extract rich, quantitative profiles in high throughput. The assay detects seven major cellular components. In a pilot screen of bioactive compounds, the assay detected a range of cellular phenotypes and it clustered compounds with similar annotated protein targets or chemical structure based on cytological profiles. The results demonstrate that the assay captures subtle patterns in the combination of morphological labels, thereby detecting the effects of chemical compounds even though their targets are not stained directly. This image-based assay provides an unbiased approach to characterize compound- and disease-associated cell states to support future probe discovery.},

Currently available methods offer very limited throughput and are not amenable to studies of comparative pharmacology or small-scale screening. The authors present an automated approach to high-content tumor cell migration assays. A standard screening-sized plate with an array of microchannels was designed and constructed from common thermoplastics. After filling the channels with 3D matrix, cells were placed at one end of the channel, and migration into the channel was monitored via an imaging system. All liquid-handling steps were performed by standard liquid-handling robotics. Tumor cell migration in the channel was truly 3D and correlated with metastatic potential. The information-rich data from these assays were used to rank the potency of compounds inhibiting migration through 3D collagen as well as to gain additional insights into the compounds' activities related to cell health. This approach is compatible with a variety of multiparametric, morphological, and/or kinetic readouts.},

abstract = {Since their identification in 1994, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been objects of intensive study. Their properties and mechanisms of formation have become a major focus of current cancer research, in part because of their enhanced ability to initiate and drive tumour growth and their intrinsic resistance to conventional therapeutics. The discovery that activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme in carcinoma cells can give rise to cells with stem-like properties has provided one possible mechanism explaining how CSCs arise and presents a possible avenue for their therapeutic manipulation. Here we address recent developments in CSC research, focusing on carcinomas that are able to undergo EMT. We discuss the signalling pathways that create these cells, cell-intrinsic mechanisms that could be exploited for selective elimination or induction of their differentiation, and the role of the tumour microenvironment in sustaining them. Finally, we propose ways to use our current knowledge of the complex biology of CSCs to design novel therapies to eliminate them. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental program that is often activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. We here report that the induction of an EMT in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLEs) results in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and in the expression of stem-cell markers. Furthermore, we show that those cells have an increased ability to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells. Independent of this, stem cell-like cells isolated from HMLE cultures form mammospheres and express markers similar to those of HMLEs that have undergone an EMT. Moreover, stem-like cells isolated either from mouse or human mammary glands or mammary carcinomas express EMT markers. Finally, transformed human mammary epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT form mammospheres, soft agar colonies, and tumors more efficiently. These findings illustrate a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cell migration through 3D tissue depends on a physicochemical balance between cell deformability and physical tissue constraints. Migration rates are further governed by the capacity to degrade ECM by proteolytic enzymes, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and integrin- and actomyosin-mediated mechanocoupling. Yet, how these parameters cooperate when space is confined remains unclear. Using MMP-degradable collagen lattices or nondegradable substrates of varying porosity, we quantitatively identify the limits of cell migration by physical arrest. MMP-independent migration declined as linear function of pore size and with deformation of the nucleus, with arrest reached at 10{\%} of the nuclear cross section (tumor cells, 7 µm²; T cells, 4 µm²; neutrophils, 2 µm²). Residual migration under space restriction strongly depended upon MMP-dependent ECM cleavage by enlarging matrix pore diameters, and integrin- and actomyosin-dependent force generation, which jointly propelled the nucleus. The limits of interstitial cell migration thus depend upon scaffold porosity and deformation of the nucleus, with pericellular collagenolysis and mechanocoupling as modulators.},
annote = {MMP-independent migration is limited by nucleus deformation and pore sizes below 7-10 uM{\^{}}2


Above certain pore sizes, proteolysis does not play a rate-limiting role and is dispensible.


There is a middle ground during which inhibition of collagenlysis slows migration due to the amelioration of pore widening, though cells can ultimately squeeze through or find alternative routes.},

Building on new mechanistic insights emerging from recent research, we offer our perspective on the metastatic process and reflect on possible paths of future exploration.

Although much remains to be learned about the second phase, we feel that an understanding of the first phase is now within sight, due in part to a better understanding of how cancer cell behavior can be modified by a cell-biological program called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

Epigenetic regulation encompasses three types of changes: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, each of which has been shown to play a key role in controlling epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. As we gain deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms controlling EMT processes and orchestrating all the metastatic steps, we broaden the therapeutic potentials of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA demethylating drugs and histone deacetylase/demethylase inhibitors, which can act upon metastasis-related genes, restoring their expression and biological functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Unfortunately, resistance almost invariably develops. Recently, a phenomenon called "phenotype switching" has been identified as an escape route. By switching from a proliferative to an invasive state, melanoma cells can acquire resistance to these targeted therapeutics. Interestingly, phenotype switching bears a striking resemblance to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition that has been described to occur in cancer stem cells in other tumor types. We propose that these changes are manifestations of one and the same underlying feature, namely a dynamic and reversible phenotypic tumor cell plasticity that renders a proportion of cells both more invasive and resistant to therapy. At the same time, the specific characteristics of these tumor cell populations offer potential for being explored as target for therapeutic intervention.

abstract = {Epigenetic events, which are somatically inherited through cell division, are potential drivers of acquired drug resistance in cancer. The high rate of epigenetic change in tumours generates diversity in gene expression patterns that can rapidly evolve through drug selection during treatment, leading to the development of acquired resistance. This will potentially confound stratified chemotherapy decisions that are solely based on mutation biomarkers. Poised epigenetic states in tumour cells may drive multistep epigenetic fixation of gene expression during the acquisition of drug resistance, which has implications for clinical strategies to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.},

abstract = {Secretion of C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) by mammary tumours recruits CCR2-expressing inflammatory monocytes to primary tumours and metastatic sites, and CCL2 neutralization in mice inhibits metastasis by retaining monocytes in the bone marrow. Here we report a paradoxical effect of CCL2 in four syngeneic mouse models of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, interruption of CCL2 inhibition leads to an overshoot of metastases and accelerates death. This is the result of monocyte release from the bone marrow and enhancement of cancer cell mobilization from the primary tumour, as well as blood vessel formation and increased proliferation of metastatic cells in the lungs in an interleukin (IL)-6- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-dependent manner. Notably, inhibition of CCL2 and IL-6 markedly reduced metastases and increased survival of the animals. CCL2 has been implicated in various neoplasias and adopted as a therapeutic target. However, our results call for caution when considering anti-CCL2 agents as monotherapy in metastatic disease and highlight the tumour microenvironment as a critical determinant of successful anti-metastatic therapy.},

With few treatment options available, new drug targets specific for HER2-positive breast cancer are needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a pharmacological profiling of seven genotypically distinct breast cancer cell lines using a subset of inhibitors of breast cancer cells from a screen of the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. To identify molecular targets of nelfinavir, identified in the screen as a selective inhibitor of HER2-positive cells, we conducted a genome-wide screen of a haploinsufficiency yeast mutant collection. We evaluated antitumor activity of nelfinavir with xenografts in athymic nude mouse models (n = 4-6 per group) of human breast cancer and repeated mixed-effects regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Pharmacological profiling showed that nelfinavir, an anti-HIV drug, selectively inhibited the growth of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in vitro. A genome-wide screening of haploinsufficiency yeast mutants revealed that nelfinavir inhibited heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) function. Further characterization using proteolytic footprinting experiments indicated that nelfinavir inhibited HSP90 in breast cancer cells through a novel mechanism. In vivo, nelfinavir selectively inhibited the growth of HER2-positive breast cancer cells (tumor volume index of HCC1954 cells on day 29, vehicle vs nelfinavir, mean = 14.42 vs 5.16, difference = 9.25, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 5.93 to 12.56, P {\textless} .001; tumor volume index of BT474 cells on day 26, vehicle vs nelfinavir, mean = 2.21 vs 0.90, difference = 1.31, 95{\%} CI = 0.83 to 1.78, P {\textless} .001). Moreover, nelfinavir inhibited the growth of trastuzumab- and/or lapatinib-resistant, HER2-positive breast cancer cells in vitro at clinically achievable concentrations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Nelfinavir was found to be a new class of HSP90 inhibitor and can be brought to HER2-breast cancer treatment trials with the same dosage regimen as that used among HIV patients.},

abstract = {The suppression of cancer metastasis is an urgent therapeutic need. Yet, most existing drugs inhibit only cancer cell proliferation. Historically, the reason is the much later elucidation of the molecular biology of metastasis versus that of the early steps in transformation. Because the molecules that drive the dissemination of malignant cells are shared among cancers, drugs that inhibit their functions will be broadly beneficial. There are two complementary anti-metastasis strategies, the prevention of cancer cell dissemination and the suppression of already existing metastases. To accelerate the availability of potentially life-saving anti-metastasis agents several adjustments must be made. The risk tolerance in drug trials needs to increase with a worsening prognosis. Clinical trials of drug molecules that prevent cancer dissemination need to be approved for use right after diagnosis, not after failure of standard-of-care therapies. For agents that treat existing metastases, the clinical trial system needs to be modernized. Because cancer metastasis is often fatal, improved and innovative approaches to anti-metastasis drugs are eminently suited to play a lead role in changing the standards of drug development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bortezomib, a boronic acid dipeptide, is a novel proteasome inhibitor that has been shown in preclinical and phase 1 studies to have antimyeloma activity. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, phase 2 trial, we enrolled 202 patients with relapsed myeloma that was refractory to the therapy they had received most recently. Patients received 1.3 mg of bortezomib per square meter of body-surface area twice weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week without treatment, for up to eight cycles (24 weeks). In patients with a suboptimal response, oral dexamethasone (20 mg daily, on the day of and the day after bortezomib administration) was added to the regimen. The response was evaluated according to the criteria of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and confirmed by an independent review committee. RESULTS: Of 193 patients who could be evaluated, 92 percent had been treated with three or more of the major classes of agents for myeloma, and in 91 percent, the myeloma was refractory to the therapy received most recently. The rate of response to bortezomib was 35 percent, and those with a response included 7 patients in whom myeloma protein became undetectable and 12 in whom myeloma protein was detectable only by immunofixation. The median overall survival was 16 months, with a median duration of response of 12 months. Grade 3 adverse events included thrombocytopenia (in 28 percent of patients), fatigue (in 12 percent), peripheral neuropathy (in 12 percent), and neutropenia (in 11 percent). Grade 4 events occurred in 14 percent of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib, a member of a new class of anticancer drugs, is active in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy.},

Here, using a large database that contains information on R{\&}D projects for more than 28,000 compounds investigated since 1990, we examine the decline of R{\&}D productivity in pharmaceuticals in the past two decades and its determinants. We show that this decline is associated with an increasing concentration of R{\&}D investments in areas in which the risk of failure is high, which correspond to unmet therapeutic needs and unexploited biological mechanisms. We also investigate the potential variations in productivity with regard to the regional location of companies and find that although companies based in the United States and Europe differ in the composition of their R{\&}D portfolios, there is no evidence of any productivity gap.},

Basic steps involved in cell migration have been defined for two-dimensional haptokinetic migration which, however, does not provide physical constraints imposed by three-dimensional interstitial tissues. We here describe the process of pericellular proteolysis that leads to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and realignment during cell movement and integrate it into established steps of cell migration. After actin-driven leading edge protrusion (step I) and anterior formation of integrin-mediated focal interactions to the substrate (step II), ECM breakdown is focalized towards physical ECM barriers several micrometer rearward of the leading edge (step III). Actomyosin-mediated cell contraction (step IV) then leads to rear-end retraction and forward sliding of cell body and nucleus so that a small tube-like matrix defect bordered by realigned ECM fibers becomes apparent (step V). Pericellular proteolysis is thus integral to the migration cycle and serves to widen ECM gaps and thereby lowers physical stress upon the cell body, which ultimately leads to aligned higher-oder ECM patterns.},

abstract = {For cancer progression and metastatic dissemination, cancer cells migrate and penetrate through extracellular tissues. Cancer invasion is frequently facilitated by proteolytic processing of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The cellular regions mediating proteolysis are diverse and depend upon the physical structure, composition, and dimensionality of the ECM contacted by the cell surface. Cancer cells migrating across 2D substrate contain proteolytic structures such as lamellipodia, invadopodia, and the trailing edge. Likewise, invasive mesenchymal migration through 3D fibrillar ECM, as monitored for HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by submicron-resolved imaging, is mediated by several types of proteolytic structures rich in filamentous actin, ss1 integrin, and MT1-MMP with distinct location and function. These comprise (i) anterior pseudopod bifurcataions and the nucleus corresponding to zones of local cell compression by constraining collagen fibers, (ii) lateral small spikes that protrude into the ECM and cause small spot-like proteolytic foci, and (iii) a strongly proteolytic trailing edge sliding along reorganized ECM fibers. Through their combined action these proteolytic surface structures cleave, remove, and realign ECM barriers, support rear end retraction, generate tube-like matrix defects and laterally widen existing tracks during 3D tissue invasion.},

Basic properties of Euclidean distance matrices are established; in particular, when $\rho$=rank(D) it is shown that, depending on whether eTD-e is not or is zero, the generating points lie in either p=$\rho$-1 dimensions, in which case they lie on a hypersphere, or in p=$\rho$-2 dimensions, in which case they do not. (The notation e is used for a vector all of whose values are one.) When D is non-Euclidean its dimensionality p=r+s will comprise r real and s imaginary columns of X, and (r, s) are invariant for all generating X of minimal rank. Higher-ranking representations can arise only from p+1=(r+1)+s or p+1=r+ (s+1) or p+2=(r+1)+(s+1), so that not only are r, s invariant, but they are both minimal for all admissible representations X. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Technical advancements produces a huge amount of scientific data which are usually in high dimensional formats, and it is getting more important to analyze those large-scale high-dimensional data. Dimension reduction is a well-known approach for high-dimensional data visualization, but can be very time and memory demanding for large problems. Among many dimension reduction methods, multidimensional scaling does not require explicit vector representation but uses pair-wise dissimilarities of data, so that it has a broader applicability than the other algorithms which can handle only vector representation. In this paper,we propose an efficient parallel implementation of a well-knownmultidimensional scaling algorithm, called SMACOF (Scaling byMAjorizing aCOmplicated Function)which is time andmemory consuming with a quadratic complexity, via aMessage Passing Interface (MPI).We have achieved load balancing in the proposed parallelSMACOF implementation which results in high efficiency. The proposed parallel SMACOF implementation shows the efficient parallel performance through the experimental results, and it increases the computing capacity of the SMACOF algorithm to several hundreds of thousands of data via using a 32-node cluster system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the invasion and metastasis of human cancers by mediating the degradation of extracellular matrix components. Therefore, these enzymes constitute promising targets in the development of anticancer therapies. Batimastat ([(4-N-hydroxyamino)-2R-isobutyl-3S-(thienyl-thiomethyl)succinyl]-L- phenyl-alanine-N-methylamide) is one of a new class of agents designed to inhibit MMP activity. PURPOSE: We asked whether batimastat, given as adjuvant therapy after primary tumor resection, could inhibit local-regional tumor regrowth and the formation of lung metastases in a human breast cancer xenograft model. We also explored possible effects of batimastat on breast cancer cell viability and on the accumulation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs). METHODS: Human MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells were treated in vitro for 6 days with batimastat at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 microM, and then viable cell counts were performed. The activity of collagenases, directly associated with cultured MDA-MB-435 cells or released into their culture fluids, was assessed by gelatin zymography after 1 and 3 days of batimastat treatment (drug range, 0.2-2.0 microM). Athymic nude mice were given daily intraperitoneal injections of batimastat (30 mg/kg body weight) after resection of MDA-MB-435 primary tumors grown in their mammary fat pads; the volumes of tumor regrowths and the numbers and volumes of lung metastases were calculated; neovascularization in the regrowths was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody directed against CD31, an endothelial cell antigen. The effect of batimastat treatment on the accumulation of mRNAs encoding specific MMPs and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) in cultured cells, primary tumors, and tumor regrowths was measured by RNA dot blotting and hybridization with complementary probes. Linear regression analysis, Student's t tests, and chi-squared analysis were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: The viability of cultured MDA-MB-435 cells was not affected by treatment with batimastat; however, measured activities for the 72-kd and 92-kd collagenases released by these cells were reduced after batimastat treatment. Intraperitoneal injection of batimastat significantly inhibited the local-regional regrowth of resected MDA-MB-435 tumors in athymic nude mice (in comparison with control mice, P = .035), and it reduced the incidence (P {\textless} .05), number (P = .0001), and total volume (P = .0001) of lung metastases. Batimastat treatment did not affect cellular levels of MMP or TIMP-2 mRNAs. CONCLUSION: Batimastat inhibits human breast cancer regrowth and metastasis in a nude mouse xenograft model. Potential mechanisms for batimastat's inhibitory activity do not include direct cell toxicity or alteration of MMP or TIMP mRNA levels.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) high-content screening (HCS) enables massive parallel gene silencing and is increasingly being used to reveal novel connections between genes and disease-relevant phenotypes. The application of genome-scale RNAi relies on the development of high quality HCS assays. The Z' factor statistic provides a way to evaluate whether or not screening run conditions (reagents, protocols, instrumentation, kinetics, and other conditions not directly related to the test compounds) are optimized. Z' factor, introduced by Zhang et al. (1), is a dimensionless value that represents both the variability and the dynamic range between two sets of sample control data. This paper describes a new extension of the Z' factor, which integrates multiple readouts for screening quality assessment. Currently presented multivariate Z' factor is based on linear projection, which may not be suitable for data with nonlinear structure. This paper proposes an algorithm which extends existing algorithm to deal with nonlinear data by using the kernel function. Using kernel methods for projections, multiple readouts are condensed to a single parameter, based on which the screening run quality is monitored.},

Traditional serial dilutions that use aqueous diluents can result in errors in dose-response values of up to 4 orders of magnitude for a significant percentage of a compound library. When DMSO is used as the diluent, the errors are reduced but not eliminated. The authors use acoustic drop ejection (ADE) to transfer different volumes of model library compounds, directly creating a concentration gradient series in the receiver assay plate. Sample losses and contamination associated with compound handling are therefore avoided or minimized, particularly in the case of less water-soluble compounds. ADE is particularly well suited for assay miniaturization, but gradient volume dispensing is not limited to miniaturized applications.},

abstract = {Imaging-based high-content screens often rely on single cell-based evaluation of phenotypes in large data sets of microscopic images. Traditionally, these screens are analyzed by extracting a few image-related parameters and use their ratios (linear single or multiparametric separation) to classify the cells into various phenotypic classes. In this study, the authors show how machine learning-based classification of individual cells outperforms those classical ratio-based techniques. Using fluorescent intensity and morphological and texture features, they evaluated how the performance of data analysis increases with increasing feature numbers. Their findings are based on a case study involving an siRNA screen monitoring nucleoplasmic and nucleolar accumulation of a fluorescently tagged reporter protein. For the analysis, they developed a complete analysis workflow incorporating image segmentation, feature extraction, cell classification, hit detection, and visualization of the results. For the classification task, the authors have established a new graphical framework, the Advanced Cell Classifier, which provides a very accurate high-content screen analysis with minimal user interaction, offering access to a variety of advanced machine learning methods.},

More formally, MDS refers to a set of statistical techniques that are used to reduce the complexity of a data set, permitting visual appreciation of the underlying relational structures contained therein. The current paper provides an overview of MDS. We discuss key aspects of performing this technique, such as methods that can be used to collect similarity estimates, analytic techniques for treating proximity data, and various concerns regarding interpretation of the MDS output. MDS analyses of two novel data sets are also included, highlighting in step-by-step fashion how MDS is performed, and key issues that may arise during analysis.},

abstract = {Genetic screens for phenotypic similarity have made key contributions to associating genes with biological processes. With RNA interference (RNAi), highly parallel phenotyping of loss-of-function effects in cells has become feasible. One of the current challenges however is the computational categorization of visual phenotypes and the prediction of biological function and processes. In this study, we describe a combined computational and experimental approach to discover novel gene functions and explore functional relationships. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in human cells and used quantitative descriptors derived from high-throughput imaging to generate multiparametric phenotypic profiles. We show that profiles predicted functions of genes by phenotypic similarity. Specifically, we examined several candidates including the largely uncharacterized gene DONSON, which shared phenotype similarity with known factors of DNA damage response (DDR) and genomic integrity. Experimental evidence supports that DONSON is a novel centrosomal protein required for DDR signalling and genomic integrity. Multiparametric phenotyping by automated imaging and computational annotation is a powerful method for functional discovery and mapping the landscape of phenotypic responses to cellular perturbations.},

abstract = {Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states have crucial roles in embryonic development. Emerging data suggest a role for these processes in regulating cellular plasticity in normal adult tissues and in tumours, where they can generate multiple, distinct cellular subpopulations contributing to intratumoural heterogeneity. Some of these subpopulations may exhibit more differentiated features, whereas others have characteristics of stem cells. Owing to the importance of these tumour-associated phenotypes in metastasis and cancer-related mortality, targeting the products of such cellular plasticity is an attractive but challenging approach that is likely to lead to improved clinical management of cancer patients.},

abstract = {Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. ErbB2, a metastasis-promoting oncoprotein, is overexpressed in 50-60{\%} of noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, only 25{\%} of invasive breast cancer (IBC) overexpress ErbB2, indicating that ErbB2 alone is not sufficient to drive metastasis and additional risk factors are necessary for the progression of ErbB2-overexpressing DCIS to IBC. A recent study published in Cancer Cell identified 14-3-3xi as a risk factor aiding the transition of ErbB2-overexpressing DCIS into IBC. Furthermore, the study elucidated molecular mechanisms by which ErbB2 and 14-3-3xi co-overexpression drives metastasis. Namely, ErbB2 promotes cell motility and migration via the activation of Src, while 14-3-3xi induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition by activating TGFbeta pathway to reduce cell adhesion. On the other hand, two studies recently published in British Journal of Cancer and Oncogene provide mechanistic insight into how ErbB2 signalling is transduced via Src, focal adhesion kinase and Ste20-like kinase to regulate focal adhesion turnover and modulate cell motility and migration. Taken together, these studies reveal that metastasis engages a variety of players that must show team spirit to win the game of spreading.},

Preclinical studies testing the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were so compelling that synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors (MPIs) were rapidly developed and routed into human clinical trials. The results of these trials have been disappointing. Here we review the studies that brought MPIs into clinical testing and discuss the design and outcome of the trials in light of new information about the cellular source, substrates, and mode of action of MMPs at different stages of tumor progression. The important lessons learned from the MPI experience may be of great value for future studies of MPIs and for cancer drug development in general.},

abstract = {Cancer research depends on the use of human cell lines for both the in vitro (culture) and in vivo (xenograft) analysis of tumor progression and treatment. However, the extent to which cultured preparations of human cancer lines display similar properties in vivo, where important host factors may influence tumor biology, remains unclear. Here, we address this question by conducting a functional proteomic analysis of the human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 grown in culture and as orthotopic xenograft tumors in the mammary fad pad of immunodeficient mice. Using a suite of activity-based chemical probes, we identified carcinoma (human) enzyme activities that were expressed selectively in culture or in xenograft tumors. Likewise, distinct groups of stromal (mouse) enzyme activities were found that either infiltrated or were excluded from xenograft tumors, indicating a contribution by specific host components to breast cancer development. MDA-MB-231 cells isolated from tumors exhibited profound differences in their enzyme activity profiles compared with the parent cell line, including the dramatic posttranscriptional up-regulation of the serine proteases urokinase plasminogen activator and tissue plasminogen activator and down-regulation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase. These altered enzyme activity profiles correlated with significantly greater tumor growth rates and metastases for xenograft-derived MDA-MB-231 cells upon reintroduction into mice. Collectively, these data indicate that the in vivo environment of the mouse mammary fat pad cultivates the growth of human breast cancer cells with elevated tumorigenic properties and highlight the value of activity-based protein profiling for identifying proteomic signatures that depict such changes in cancer cell biology.},

The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the "suitability" of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called "Z- factor," is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation},

This class of algorithms is a set of heuristic procedures that suffers from several major problems (e.g. neither termination or convergence is guaranteed, no model is optimized by the learning strategy, and the output is often dependent on the sequence of data). A fuzzy Kohonen clustering network is proposed which integrates the Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) model into the learning rate and updating strategies of the Kohonen network. This yield an optimization problem related to FCM, and the numerical results show improved convergence as well as reduced labeling errors. It is proved that the proposed scheme is equivalent to the c-Means algorithms. The new method can be viewed as a Kohonen type of FCM, but is "self-organizing" since the "size" of the update neighborhood and learning rate in the competitive layer are automatically adjusted during learning. Anderson's IRIS data is used to illustrate this method; and results are compared with the standard Kohonen approach. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{VanderSluis2013,
abstract = {To date, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the primary tool to identify genetic variants that cause phenotypic variation. As GWAS analyses are generally univariate in nature, multivariate phenotypic information is usually reduced to a single composite score. This practice often results in loss of statistical power to detect causal variants. Multivariate genotype-phenotype methods do exist but attain maximal power only in special circumstances. Here, we present a new multivariate method that we refer to as TATES (Trait-based Association Test that uses Extended Simes procedure), inspired by the GATES procedure proposed by Li et al (2011). For each component of a multivariate trait, TATES combines p-values obtained in standard univariate GWAS to acquire one trait-based p-value, while correcting for correlations between components. Extensive simulations, probing a wide variety of genotype-phenotype models, show that TATES's false positive rate is correct, and that TATES's statistical power to detect causal variants explaining 0.5{\%} of the variance can be 2.5-9 times higher than the power of univariate tests based on composite scores and 1.5-2 times higher than the power of the standard MANOVA. Unlike other multivariate methods, TATES detects both genetic variants that are common to multiple phenotypes and genetic variants that are specific to a single phenotype, i.e. TATES provides a more complete view of the genetic architecture of complex traits. As the actual causal genotype-phenotype model is usually unknown and probably phenotypically and genetically complex, TATES, available as an open source program, constitutes a powerful new multivariate strategy that allows researchers to identify novel causal variants, while the complexity of traits is no longer a limiting factor.},

abstract = {Studies using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum have greatly contributed to the current understanding of the signaling network that underlies chemotaxis. Since directed migration is essential for normal D. discoideum multicellular development, mutants with chemotactic impairments are likely to have abnormal developmental morphologies. We have used multicellular development as a readout in a screen of mutants to identify new potential regulators of chemotaxis. In this chapter, we describe how mutants generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) are analyzed, from assessment of development to detailed characterization of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced responses. Two complementary approaches, plating cells either clonally on a bacterial lawn or as a population on non-nutrient agar, are used to evaluate multicellular development. Once mutants with aberrant developmental phenotypes are identified, their chemotaxis toward cAMP is assessed by both small population and micropipette assays. Furthermore, mutants are tested for defects in both general and specific signaling pathways by examining the recruitment of actin-binding LimE($\Delta$coil) or PIP3-binding PH domains to the plasma membrane in response to cAMP stimulation.},

Rho signalling through ROCK promotes a rounded bleb-associated mode of motility that does not require pericellular proteolysis. This form of motility requires ezrin, which is localized in the direction of cell movement. In contrast, elongated cell motility is associated with Rac-dependent F-actin-rich protrusions and does not require Rho, ROCK or ezrin function. Combined blockade of extracellular proteases and ROCK negates the ability of tumour cells to switch between modes of motility and synergises to prevent tumour cell invasion.},

abstract = {Cell spreading, adhesion and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) involve bi-directional signalling and physical linkages between the ECM, integrins and the cell cytoskeleton. The actin-binding proteins talin1 and 2 link ligand-bound integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and increase the affinity of integrin for the ECM. Here we report that depletion of talin2 in talin1-null (talin1(-/-)) cells did not affect the initiation of matrix-activated spreading or Src family kinase (SFK) activation, but abolished the ECM-integrin-cytoskeleton linkage and sustained cell spreading and adhesion. Specifically, focal adhesion assembly, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling and traction force generation on substrates were severely affected. The talin1 head domain restored beta1 integrin activation but only full-length talin1 restored the ECM-cytoskeleton linkage and normal cytoskeleton organization. Our results demonstrate three biochemically distinct steps in fibronectin-activated cell spreading and adhesion: (1) fibronectin-integrin binding and initiation of spreading, (2) fast cell spreading and (3) focal adhesion formation and substrate traction. We suggest that talin is not required for initial cell spreading. However, talin provides the important mechanical linkage between ligand-bound integrins and the actin cytoskeleton required to catalyse focal adhesion-dependent pathways.},

abstract = {Tumor cells exhibit two different modes of individual cell movement. Mesenchymal-type movement is characterized by an elongated cellular morphology and requires extracellular proteolysis. In amoeboid movement, cells have a rounded morphology, are less dependent on proteases, and require high Rho-kinase signaling to drive elevated levels of actomyosin contractility. These two modes of cell movement are interconvertible. We show that mesenchymal-type movement in melanoma cells is driven by activation of the GTPase Rac through a complex containing NEDD9, a recently identified melanoma metastasis gene, and DOCK3, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rac signals through WAVE2 to direct mesenchymal movement and suppress amoeboid movement through decreasing actomyosin contractility. Conversely, in amoeboid movement, Rho-kinase signaling activates a Rac GAP, ARHGAP22, that suppresses mesenchymal movement by inactivating Rac. We demonstrate tight interplay between Rho and Rac in determining different modes of tumor cell movement, revealing how tumor cells switch between different modes of movement. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Invasive tumor dissemination in vitro and in vivo involves the proteolytic degradation of ECM barriers. This process, however, is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor-based treatment, suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of beta 1 integrins and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases, however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered beta 1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy. In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis.},

The screens have identified eight mutations, representing six loci. Mutations at three of the loci result in only maternal effects on embryonic viability. Mutations at the remaining three loci cause additional nonmaternal (zygotic) effects, including recessive lethality or sterility and dominant male mating defects. Mutations at five of the loci cause visible pregastrulation defects. Three mutations appear to be allelic with a recessive mutation of let-354. Gene dosage experiments indicate that one mutation may be a loss-of-function allele at a haploin sufficient locus. The other mutations appear to result in gain-of-function "poison" gene products. Most of these become less deleterious as the relative dosage of the corresponding wild-type allele is increased; we show that relative self-progeny viabilities for the relevant hermaphrodite genotypes are generally M/+/+ greater than M/+ greater than M/M/+ greater than M/Df greater than M/M, where M represents the dominant mutant allele.},

abstract = {Haptokinetic cell migration across surfaces is mediated by adhesion receptors including beta1 integrins and CD44 providing adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands such as collagen and hyaluronan (HA), respectively. Little is known, however, about how such different receptor systems synergize for cell migration through three-dimensionally (3-D) interconnected ECM ligands. In highly motile human MV3 melanoma cells, both beta1 integrins and CD44 are abundantly expressed, support migration across collagen and HA, respectively, and are deposited upon migration, whereas only beta1 integrins but not CD44 redistribute to focal adhesions. In 3-D collagen lattices in the presence or absence of HA and cross-linking chondroitin sulfate, MV3 cell migration and associated functions such as polarization and matrix reorganization were blocked by anti-beta1 and anti-alpha2 integrin mAbs, whereas mAbs blocking CD44, alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, or alphav integrins showed no effect. With use of highly sensitive time-lapse videomicroscopy and computer-assisted cell tracking techniques, promigratory functions of CD44 were excluded. 1) Addition of HA did not increase the migratory cell population or its migration velocity, 2) blocking of the HA-binding Hermes-1 epitope did not affect migration, and 3) impaired migration after blocking or activation of beta1 integrins was not restored via CD44. Because alpha2beta1-mediated migration was neither synergized nor replaced by CD44-HA interactions, we conclude that the biophysical properties of 3-D multicomponent ECM impose more restricted molecular functions of adhesion receptors, thereby differing from haptokinetic migration across surfaces.},

Using a multiparameter tuning model, we describe how dimension, density, stiffness, and orientation of the extracellular matrix together with cell determinants-including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, cytoskeletal polarity and stiffness, and pericellular proteolysis-interdependently control migration mode and efficiency. Motile cells integrate variable inputs to adjust interactions among themselves and with the matrix to dictate the migration mode.

annote = {Ameboid migration lacks mature focal adhesions and stress fibres


Mesenchymal migrations relies on high levels of attachment and cytoskeletal contractility which involves focal adhesions


The common underlying theme of migration is polarized acto-myosin driven shape change in the cell body.


2D migration requires unilateral adhesion to the substrate, providing a stable but transient attachment, and a flattened cell morphology guided by a leading lamellipodia.


3D migration through interstitial tissue consisting of a network of collagen fibres requires a spindle-shaped morphology with unilateral polarisation to the underlying substrate. Leading edge protrusion occurs by formation of pseudopodia that orient in 3 dimensions. The cell also accomodates into small tissue gaps or exucutes remodelling of the ECM structure by pericellular proteolysis.


Depending on the deformability of the migrating cell and the size of gaps and trails available in tissue, cells proteolytically remodel surrounding ECM and generate their own gaps, a hallmark of mesenchymal migration - otherwise they move without engaging proteases, by filling available spaces with their cell body.},

@article{Volakis2014,
abstract = {Cell migration plays a central role in the invasion and metastasis of tumors. As cells leave the primary tumor, they undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate as single cells. Epithelial tumor cells may also migrate in a highly directional manner as a collective group in some settings. We previously discovered that myoferlin (MYOF) is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and depletion of MYOF results in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and reduced invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the biomechanical mechanisms governing cell motility during MYOF depletion are poorly understood. We first demonstrated that lentivirus-driven shRNA-induced MYOF loss in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA-231(MYOF-KD)) leads to an epithelial morphology compared to the mesenchymal morphology observed in control (MDA-231(LTVC)) and wild-type cells. Knockdown of MYOF led to significant reductions in cell migration velocity and MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells migrated directionally and collectively, while MDA-231(LTVC) cells exhibited single cell migration. Decreased migration velocity and collective migration were accompanied by significant changes in cell mechanics. MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells exhibited a 2-fold decrease in cell stiffness, a 2-fold increase in cell-substrate adhesion and a 1.5-fold decrease in traction force generation. In vivo studies demonstrated that when immunocompromised mice were implanted with MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells, tumors were smaller and demonstrated lower tumor burden. Moreover, MDA-231(MYOF-KD) tumors were highly circularized and did not invade locally into the adventia in contrast to MDA-231(LTVC)-injected animals. Thus MYOF loss is associated with a change in tumor formation in xenografts and leads to smaller, less invasive tumors. These data indicate that MYOF, a previously unrecognized protein in cancer, is involved in MDA-MB-231 cell migration and contributes to biomechanical alterations. Our results indicate that changes in biomechanical properties following loss of this protein may be an effective way to alter the invasive capacity of cancer cells.},
annote = {MYOF -{\textgreater} myoferlin 


knockdown of MYOF in MDA-MB-231 cells causes them to migrate in a collective fashion, though overall migration is roughly the same as control cells, they migrate at a slower velocity in a more direct path.


WT cells have greater velocity and a winding uncoordinated path.


Maybe once cells gathered in a collective, random variations in their migratory path are cancelled by one another, and this results in the more direct migratory path?

abstract = {In this article, we discussed the emerging informatics issues of high-throughput screening (HTS) using automated fluorescence microscopy technology, otherwise known as high-content screening (HCS) in the pharmaceutical industry. Optimal methods of scoring biomarkers and identifying candidate hits have been actively studied in academia and industry, with the exception of data modeling topics. To find candidate hits, we need to score the images associated with different compound interventions. In the application example of RNAi genome-wide screening, we aim to find the candidate effectors or genes which correspond to the images acquired using the three channels. Scoring the effectors is equivalent to scoring the images based on the number of phenotypes existing in those images. Our ultimate objective of studying HTS is to model the relationship between gene networks and cellular phenotypes, investigate cellular communication via protein interaction, and study the disease mechanism beyond the prediction based on the molecular structure of the compound. Finally, computational image analysis has become a powerful tool in cellular and molecular biology studies. Signal processing and modeling for high-throughput image screening is an emerging filed that requires novel algorithms for dynamical system analysis, image processing, and statistical modeling. We hope that this article will motivate the signal processing communities to address challenging data modeling and other informatics issues of HTS},

abstract = {In this review a short introduction to the concept and experimental realization of single molecule multiparameter fluorescence spectroscopy is presented. The approach of Multiparameter Fluorescence Detection (MFD) is essentially the time-resolved observation of all five intrinsic properties of a chromophore that can be probed in a fluorescence experiment, i.e. spectral properties of absorption and fluorescence, F($\lambda$A, $\lambda$F), fluorescence quantum yield, $\Phi$F, fluorescence lifetime, $\tau$, and anisotropy, r. This harbors the potential to combine Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) in a single experiment. Additionally, species selective analysis of subensembles and even direct studies on single molecule dynamics become accessible. The application of MFD to complex multichromophoric systems is discussed. Examples range from studies of Donor-Acceptor pairs showing intra- or intermolecular Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) for revealing dynamical and statical structural informations of biologically relevant macromolecules to the development of vastly improved analytical tools for the accurate identification of target molecules in multicomponent systems as needed in todays and future High-Throughput Screening (HTS) efforts. Many theoretical models of interactions and chemical reactions have been described on the molecular level although the primary source for our knowledge on chemical structure and dynamics so far are studies on molecule ensembles. Such studies, however, did not yet provide an answer to the question whether all members of the ensemble have the same properties. Here, experiments on single molecules promise new and unexpected insights, because they eliminate ensemble averaging and provide direct information on heterogeneity and kinetics of the system. That way distributions and spectra of different species in specific states are directly accessible even in heterogeneous systems},

We present several new methods for forming multivariate decision trees and compare them with several well-known methods. We compare the different methods across a variety of learning tasks, in order to assess each method's ability to find concise, accurate decision trees. The results demonstrate that some multivariate methods are in general more effective than others (in the context of our experimental assumptions). In addition; the experiments confirm that allowing multivariate tests generally improves the accuracy of the resulting decision tree over a univariate tree.},

Here, we identify two modes of tumour-cell motility in 3D matrices that involve different usage of Rho signalling. Rho signalling through ROCK promotes a rounded bleb-associated mode of motility that does not require pericellular proteolysis. This form of motility requires ezrin, which is localized in the direction of cell movement. In contrast, elongated cell motility is associated with Rac-dependent F-actin-rich protrusions and does not require Rho, ROCK or ezrin function. Combined blockade of extracellular proteases and ROCK negates the ability of tumour cells to switch between modes of motility and synergises to prevent tumour cell invasion.},

Summary

* The process of tumour-cell invasion and metastasis is conventially understood as the migration of individual cells that detach from the prmary tumour, enter lymphatic vessesls or the blood stream and seed in distant organs.


* Novel imaging techniques together with re-evaluation of histopathological pattern formation in tumours, have provided a detailed view of cellular and molecuar migration dynamics in cancer cells.


* Cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumour either as individial cells, using amoeboid- or mesenchymal-type movement, or cell sheets, strants and clusters using collective migration.


* Cancer-cell migration is typically regulated by integrins, matrix-degrading enzymes, cell-cell adhesion molecules and cell-cell communication


* Cancer therapeutics designed to target adhesion receptors or proteases have not yet been shown to be effective in clincal trials. This might be due to the fact that the cancer cell's migration mechanisms can be reprogrammed, allowing it to maintain its invasive properties via morphological and functional de-differentiation


* These adaptive responses include the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the mesenchymal-amoieboid transition (MAT) and the collective-amoeboid transtion (CAT).


* Further studies are required to identify the factors that are involved in each type of cell migration, as well as related escape strategies that are used by cancer cells after pharmcotherapeutic intervention.



Five Step Migration Model

1) Protrusion of the leading edge
2) Cell-matrix interaction and formation of focal contacts
3) Recruitment of surface proteases to ECM contacts


4) Cell contraction by actomysosin
5) Detachment of the trailing edge.



1)
Protrusion of the leading edge: Growing actin filaments connect to adaptor proteins and push the cell membrane in an outwards direction. Actin polymerises by coupling to the actin-nucleating ARP2/3 complex, which binds to WASP, a multifunctional adaptor protein. The ARP2/3-WASP complex then connects to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via clustered PIPs insertin therein. ARP2/3 can duther interact laterally with pre-existing acin filaments and induce branching of pre-existing filament to actin networks. PIPs also bind and activate GEFs that regulate the activity of the small GTPases (RAC, CDC42, RHO and RAS). In one pathway, CDC42 binds to WASP and PIPs, which activates WASP and thereby induceds filopodial ruffling and pseudopod extension. Chemokines and growth-factor receptors activate PI3K and PI45K which are they key enzymez that generate PIPs and furtherengage RAC, CDC42 and RHO.



2) Cell matrix interaction and formation of focal contacts. Integrins come into contact with ECM ligands and cluster in the cell membrane. Clustered integrins recruit adaptor and signalling proteins via their intracellular domains, therby inducing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation signals into the cell ('outside in' signalling). The integrin cytoplasmic tail directly interacts with alpha-actinin, talin, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and other proteins such as tensin. All these proteins can bind adaptor proteins - through SH2, SH3 or proline-rich domains - to recruit actin-binding proteins as well as regulatory molceules (PI3K and RHO-GTPases) to focal contacts. A link between actin/ARP2/3 complex and emerging focal contacts is provided by vinculin. The assembly of focal contacts is directly and indirectly induced by various signalling pathways.



3) Recruitment of suface proteases to CRM contacts and focalized proteolysis. Surface protease become concentrated near substrate binding sites. In close proximity to the cell surface, proteases cleave ECM components, such as collagen, fibronectin and laminins, as well as pro-MMPs to create active soluble MMPs. 



4) Cell contraction by actomyosin. Active myosin II binds to actin filaments and generates actomyosin contraction. The Ca2+ and MLCK phosphorylates the myosin light chain (MLC) which activates myosin II. This is counteracted by dephosphorylation via MLCP. RHO regulates actomyosin contraction predominantly through its effector, ROCK, which phosphorylates and inhibits MCLP.



5) Detachment of the trailing edge. At the trailing edge, focal contact dissaembly occurs through several mechanisms. Actin binding and severing proteins cap actin filaments and cause actin filament strand breakage, respectively, therby promoting filament turnover. Phosphatases limit the assembly of cytoskeletal. The cytoplasmic protease calpain cleaves focal contact components. FAK causes focal contact disassembly by yet unknown mechanisms. Focal contacts are further weakened through proteolytic cleavage of adhesion receptors by sheddases and the accumulation of collagen fragments that are generated while the cell moves forward. Following focal contact disassembly, integrins detach from the substrate and become internalised via endocytotic vesicles for recycling towards the leading edge, or deposited onto the substrate.},

abstract = {Invasive tumor dissemination in vitro and in vivo involves the proteolytic degradation of ECM barriers. This process, however, is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor-based treatment, suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of beta 1 integrins and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases, however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered beta 1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy. In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis.},

abstract = {The level of mechanistic understanding required for drug discovery is a central feature of most strategies. However, an understanding of mechanism is not required for regulatory approval. This paradox is particularly relevant to the role of phenotypic assays in drug discovery. A recent analysis revealed that phenotypic drug discovery strategies were more successful for first-in-class medicines, whereas target-based molecular strategies were more successful for followers (Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011, 10, 507-519). The rationale for the success of phenotypic screening was the unbiased identification of the molecular mechanism of action. In this follow-up analysis, the format and mechanistic information used to establish the phenotypic assays that led to the first-in-class small-molecule new molecular entities approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008 were analyzed and compared with those approved in 2012. Not surprisingly, some level of mechanistic understanding was used to select the assay formats and chemicals screened. It is concluded that mechanism takes on different connotations depending on context and perspective and that a target need not always be the exclusive definition of mechanism.},

abstract = {Preclinical strategies that are used to identify potential drug candidates include target-based screening, phenotypic screening, modification of natural substances and biologic-based approaches. To investigate whether some strategies have been more successful than others in the discovery of new drugs, we analysed the discovery strategies and the molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) for new molecular entities and new biologics that were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008. Out of the 259 agents that were approved, 75 were first-in-class drugs with new MMOAs, and out of these, 50 (67{\%}) were small molecules and 25 (33{\%}) were biologics. The results also show that the contribution of phenotypic screening to the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs exceeded that of target-based approaches - with 28 and 17 of these drugs coming from the two approaches, respectively - in an era in which the major focus was on target-based approaches. We postulate that a target-centric approach for first-in-class drugs, without consideration of an optimal MMOA, may contribute to the current high attrition rates and low productivity in pharmaceutical research and development.},

abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in the use of phenotypic screens in drug discovery as an alternative to target-focused approaches. Given that oncology is currently the most active therapeutic area, and also one in which target-focused approaches have been particularly prominent in the past two decades, we investigated the contribution of phenotypic assays to oncology drug discovery by analysing the origins of all new small-molecule cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the past 15 years and those currently in clinical development. Although the majority of these drugs originated from target-based discovery, we identified a significant number whose discovery depended on phenotypic screening approaches. We postulate that the contribution of phenotypic screening to cancer drug discovery has been hampered by a reliance on 'classical' nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity and mitotic arrest, exacerbated by a paucity of mechanistically defined cellular models for therapeutically translatable cancer phenotypes. However, technical and biological advances that enable such mechanistically informed phenotypic models have the potential to empower phenotypic drug discovery in oncology.},

abstract = {Innovation and new molecular entity production by the pharmaceutical industry has been below expectations. Surprisingly, more first-in-class small-molecule drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1999 and 2008 were identified by functional phenotypic lead generation strategies reminiscent of pre-genomics pharmacology than contemporary molecular targeted strategies that encompass the vast majority of lead generation efforts. This observation, in conjunction with the difficulty in validating molecular targets for drug discovery, has diminished the impact of the "genomics revolution" and has led to a growing grassroots movement and now broader trend in pharma to reconsider the use of modern physiology-based or phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) strategies. This "From the Guest Editors" column provides an introduction and overview of the two-part special issues of Journal of Biomolecular Screening on PDD. Terminology and the business case for use of PDD are defined. Key issues such as assay performance, chemical optimization, target identification, and challenges to the organization and implementation of PDD are discussed. Possible solutions for these challenges and a new neoclassic vision for PDD that combines phenotypic and functional approaches with technology innovations resulting from the genomics-driven era of target-based drug discovery (TDD) are also described. Finally, an overview of the manuscripts in this special edition is provided.},

abstract = {Analysis of the origins of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1999 to 2008 suggested that phenotypic screening strategies had been more productive than target-based approaches in the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs. However, given the relatively recent introduction of target-based approaches in the context of the long time frames of drug development, their full impact might not yet have become apparent. Here, we present an analysis of the origins of all 113 first-in-class drugs approved by the FDA from 1999 to 2013, which shows that the majority (78) were discovered through target-based approaches (45 small-molecule drugs and 33 biologics). In addition, of 33 drugs identified in the absence of a target hypothesis, 25 were found through a chemocentric approach in which compounds with known pharmacology served as the starting point, with only eight coming from what we define here as phenotypic screening: testing a large number of compounds in a target-agnostic assay that monitors phenotypic changes. We also discuss the implications for drug discovery strategies, including viewing phenotypic screening as a novel discipline rather than as a neoclassical approach.},

abstract = {The application of high-content imaging in conjunction with multivariate clustering techniques has recently shown value in the confirmation of cellular activity and further characterization of drug mode of action following pharmacologic perturbation. However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.},

abstract = {Cancer cells can invade three-dimensional matrices by distinct mechanisms, recently defined by their dependence on extracellular proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases. Upon treatment with protease inhibitors, some tumour cells undergo a 'mesenchymal to amoeboid' transition that allows invasion in the absence of pericellular proteolysis and matrix degradation. We show here that in HT1080 cells, this transition is associated with weakened integrin-dependent adhesion, consistently reduced cell surface expression of the alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptor and impaired signalling downstream, as judged by reduced autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). On examining cancer cells that use defined invasion strategies, we show that distinct from mesenchymal invasion, amoeboid invasion is independent of intracellular calpain 2 proteolytic activity that is usually needed for turnover of integrin-linked adhesions during two-dimensional planar migration. Moreover, an inhibitor of Rho/ROCK signalling, which specifically impairs amoeboid-like invasion, restores cell surface expression of alpha2beta1 integrin, downstream FAK autophosphorylation and calpain 2 sensitivity--features of mesenchymal invasion. These findings link weakened integrin function to a lack of requirement for calpain 2-mediated integrin adhesion turnover during amoeboid invasion. In keeping with the need for integrin adhesion turnover, mesenchymal invasion is uniquely sensitive to Src inhibitors. Thus, the need for a major pathway that controls integrin adhesion turnover defines and distinguishes cancer cell invasion strategies.},

Extension of these approaches to live cell, kinetic studies allows further spatial and temporal understanding of a multitude of dynamic functional events, including tumour cell invasion. Recent in vivo and 3D in vitro studies reveal how tumour cells utilize a diverse variety of mechanisms to permit invasion through 3D tissue environments. Such high degrees of diversity and plasticity between invasion mechanisms present a significant challenge to the successful treatment of malignant cancer. This review examines how advances in time-resolved imaging has contributed to the characterization of distinct modes of invasion and their associated molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we highlight the development of fluorescent reporter molecules and their incorporation into more predictive 3D in vitro and in vivo models, to enhance mechanistic analysis of tumour invasion. We also highlight the latest advances in kinetic imaging instrumentation applicable to in vitro and in vivo models of tumour invasion. We discuss how multiparametric image analysis can be used to interpret image data generated by these approaches. We further discuss how these approaches can be integrated into drug discovery pipelines to facilitate evaluation and selection of candidate drugs and novel pharmaceutical compositions, targeting multiple invasive mechanisms.},

However, high-attrition rates are often the result of compensatory or redundant cancer mechanisms and the fact that tumours do not find it difficult to escape inhibition of a single pathway. In this article, we highlight two emerging and complimentary technologies; namely phenotypic imaging and post-translational pathway profiling, which when combined with relevant disease models can provide pharmacodiagnostic and drug combination strategies that predict and counteract inherent and adaptive drug resistance. The implementation of such approaches at early stages of the drug discovery process enables more informed decisions on candidate drug selection and how to maximise and predict efficacy before clinical development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Recent evolution of RPPA combined with more sophisticated sample handling, optical detection, quality control, and better quality affinity-reagents provides exquisite sensitivity and high sample throughput at a reasonable cost per sample. This facilitates large-scale multiplex analysis of multiple post-translational markers across samples from in vitro, preclinical, or clinical samples. The technical power of RPPA is stimulating the application and widespread adoption of RPPA methods within academic, clinical and industrial research laboratories. Advances in RPPA technology now offer scientists the opportunity to quantify protein analytes with high precision, sensitivity, throughput and robustness. As such, adopters of RPPA technology have recognized critical success factors for useful and maximum exploitation of RPPA technologies: 1. Preservation and optimization of pre-analytical sample quality. 2. Application of validated high-affinity and specific antibody (or other protein affinity) detection reagents. 3. Dedicated informatics solutions to ensure accurate and robust quantification of protein analytes. 4. Quality assured procedures and data analysis workflows compatible with application within regulated clinical environments. In 2011 and 2012, the first two Global RPPA workshops were held in the USA and Europe, respectively. These workshops provided an opportunity for RPPA laboratories, vendors and users to share and discuss results, latest technology platforms, best practices and future challenges and opportunities. The outcomes of the 2011 and 2012 workshops included a number of key opportunities to advance the RPPA field and provide added benefit to existing and future participants of the RPPA research community.

Single-molecule multiparameter fluorescence detection also provides first information on the structure of a complex not observed by x-ray crystallography. This species did not incorporate nucleotides and is structurally distinct from the other two observed species. We determined that the nucleic acid substrate is bound at a site far removed from the nucleic acid-binding tract observed by crystallography. In contrast, the other two states are identified as being similar to the x-ray crystal structure and represent distinct enzymatically productive stages in DNA polymerization. These species differ by only a 5-A shift in the position of the nucleic acid. Addition of nucleoside triphosphate or of inorganic pyrophosphate allowed us to assign them as the educt and product state in the polymerization reaction cycle; i.e., the educt state is a complex in which the nucleic acid is positioned to allow nucleotide incorporation. The second RT:nucleic acid complex is the product state, which is formed immediately after nucleotide incorporation, but before RT translates to the next nucleotide.},

abstract = {Recent advances in automated high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and robotic handling have made the systematic and cost effective study of diverse morphological changes within a large population of cells possible under a variety of perturbations, e.g., drugs, compounds, metal catalysts, RNA interference (RNAi). Cell population-based studies deviate from conventional microscopy studies on a few cells, and could provide stronger statistical power for drawing experimental observations and conclusions. However, it is challenging to manually extract and quantify phenotypic changes from the large amounts of complex image data generated. Thus, bioimage informatics approaches are needed to rapidly and objectively quantify and analyze the image data. This paper provides an overview of the bioimage informatics challenges and approaches in image-based studies for drug and target discovery. The concepts and capabilities of image-based screening are first illustrated by a few practical examples investigating different kinds of phenotypic changes caEditorsused by drugs, compounds, or RNAi. The bioimage analysis approaches, including object detection, segmentation, and tracking, are then described. Subsequently, the quantitative features, phenotype identification, and multidimensional profile analysis for profiling the effects of drugs and targets are summarized. Moreover, a number of publicly available software packages for bioimage informatics are listed for further reference. It is expected that this review will help readers, including those without bioimage informatics expertise, understand the capabilities, approaches, and tools of bioimage informatics and apply them to advance their own studies.},

As the imaging approaches become more complex and ambitious, there is an increasing need for quantitative, computer-mediated image processing and analysis to make sense of the imagery. Bioimage Informatics is an emerging research field that covers all aspects of biological image analysis from data handling, through processing, to quantitative measurements, analysis and data presentation. Some of the most advanced, large scale projects, combining cutting edge imaging with complex bioimage informatics pipelines, are realized in the Drosophila research community. In this review, we discuss the current research in biological image analysis specifically relevant to the type of systems level image datasets that are uniquely available for the Drosophila model system. We focus on how state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms are impacting the ability of Drosophila researchers to analyze biological systems in space and time. We pay particular attention to how these algorithmic advances from computer science are made usable to practicing biologists through open source platforms and how biologists can themselves participate in their further development. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Advances in diagnosis and treatment have rendered most solid tumors largely curable if they are diagnosed and treated before dissemination. However, once they spread beyond the initial primary location, these cancers are usually highly morbid, if not fatal. Thus, current efforts focus on both limiting initial dissemination and preventing secondary spread. There are two modes of tumor dissemination - invasion and metastasis - each leading to unique therapeutic challenges and likely to be driven by distinct mechanisms. However, these two forms of dissemination utilize some common strategies to accomplish movement from the primary tumor, establishment in an ectopic site, and survival therein. The adaptive behaviors of motile cancer cells provide an opening for therapeutic approaches if we understand the molecular, cellular, and tissue biology that underlie them. Herein, we review the signaling cascades and organ reactions that lead to dissemination, as these are non-genetic in nature, focusing on cell migration as the key to tumor progression. In this context, the cellular phenotype will also be discussed because the modes of migration are dictated by quantitative and physical aspects of the cell motility machinery. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The physical sciences and engineering have introduced novel perspectives into the study of cancer through model systems, tools, and metrics that enable integration of basic science observations with clinical data. These methods have contributed to the identification of several overarching mechanisms that drive processes during cancer progression including tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. During tumor cell invasion - the first clinically observable step of metastasis - cells demonstrate diverse and evolving physical phenotypes that cannot typically be defined by any single molecular mechanism, and mechanobiology has been used to study the physical cell behaviors that comprise the "invasive phenotype". In this review, we discuss the continually evolving pathological characterization and in vitro mechanobiological characterization of tumor invasion, with emphasis on emerging physical biology and mechanobiology strategies that have contributed to a more robust mechanistic understanding of tumor cell invasion. These physical approaches may ultimately help to better predict and identify tumor metastasis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in biomedical research, drug discovery and diagnostics is understanding how seemingly identical cells can respond differently to perturbagens including drugs for disease treatment. Although heterogeneity has become an accepted characteristic of a population of cells, in drug discovery it is not routinely evaluated or reported. The standard practice for cell-based, high content assays has been to assume a normal distribution and to report a well-to-well average value with a standard deviation. To address this important issue we sought to define a method that could be readily implemented to identify, quantify and characterize heterogeneity in cellular and small organism assays to guide decisions during drug discovery and experimental cell/tissue profiling. Our study revealed that heterogeneity can be effectively identified and quantified with three indices that indicate diversity, non-normality and percent outliers. The indices were evaluated using the induction and inhibition of STAT3 activation in five cell lines where the systems response including sample preparation and instrument performance were well characterized and controlled. These heterogeneity indices provide a standardized method that can easily be integrated into small and large scale screening or profiling projects to guide interpretation of the biology, as well as the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. Understanding the heterogeneity in the response to perturbagens will become a critical factor in designing strategies for the development of therapeutics including targeted polypharmacology.},

Perturbations of synapse formation and function causally contribute to human developmental and degenerative neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders. Many genes controlling synaptogenesis have been identified, but lack of facile experimental systems has made systematic discovery of regulators of synaptogenesis challenging. Thus, we created a high-throughput platform to study excitatory and inhibitory synapse development in primary neuronal cultures and used a lentiviral RNA interference library to identify novel regulators of synapse formation. This methodology is broadly applicable for high-throughput screening of genes and drugs that may rescue or improve synaptic dysfunction associated with cognitive function and neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Autophagy plays an important role in cancer and it has been suggested that it functions not only as a tumor suppressor pathway to prevent tumor initiation, but also as a pro-survival pathway that helps tumor cells endure metabolic stress and resist death triggered by chemotherapeutic agents, including acquired resistance. We aimed to identify small-molecule autophagy inhibitors using a HTS/HCA approach through a phenotypic, cell image-based assay, in order to screen multiple biological targets simultaneously and to screen compounds in a physiologically relevant environment. LC3 is a component of the autophagosome, which undergoes a cytoplasmic redistribution from diffuse to punctate dots during autophagy. We employed HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3 in a primary phenotypic screen. As a first step, a "Validation Library" of about 8,000 pre-selected compounds, about 25{\%} of which had known biological activity and the others representing a range of chemical structures, was run in duplicate both to assess screening suitability and likely hit rate, and to give a valuable preview of possible active structures or biological targets. The primary screen of about 0.25 million compounds yielded around 10,500 positive compounds. These were tested in a suite of further cellular assays designed to eliminate unwanted positives, together with the application of chemi- and bioinformatics to pick out compounds with known biological activity. These processes enabled the selection of compounds that were the most promisingly active and specific. The screening "tree" identified, amongst others with as yet unidentified targets, chemical series active against autophagy-relevant biological targets ULK or Vsp34, validating the phenotypic screening methods selected. Finally, about 400 compounds were fully qualified after following this triage. The development of the assays, compound screening process and the compound triage is described.},

abstract = {Microtubules are important components of the cellular cytoskeleton that play roles in various cellular processes such as vesicular transport and spindle formation during mitosis. They are formed by an ordered organization of $\alpha$-tubulin and $\beta$-tubulin hetero-polymers. Altering microtubule polymerization has been known to be the mechanism of action for a number of therapeutically important drugs including taxanes and epothilones. Traditional cell-based assays for tubulin-interacting compounds rely on their indirect effects on cell cycle and/or cell proliferation. Direct monitoring of compound effects on microtubules is required to dissect detailed mechanisms of action in a cellular setting. Here we report a high-content assay platform to monitor tubulin polymerization status by directly measuring the acute effects of drug candidates on the cellular tubulin network with the capability to dissect the mechanisms of action. This high-content analysis distinguishes in a quantitative manner between compounds that act as tubulin stabilizers versus those that are tubulin destabilizers. In addition, using a multiplex approach, we expanded this analysis to simultaneously monitor physiological cellular responses and associated cellular phenotypes.},

abstract = {Phenotypic screening offers a powerful approach to identify small molecules that perturb complex biological processes in cells and organisms. The tendency of small molecules, however, to interact with multiple protein targets, often with moderate to weak affinities, along with the lack of straightforward technologies to characterize these interactions in living systems, has hindered efforts to understand the mechanistic basis for pharmacological activity. Here we address this challenge by creating a fully functionalized small-molecule library whose membership is endowed with: (1) one or more diversity elements to promote interactions with different protein targets in cells, (2) a photoreactive group for UV light-induced covalent cross-linking to interacting proteins, and (3) an alkyne handle for reporter tag conjugation to visualize and identify cross-linked proteins. A library member was found to inhibit cancer cell proliferation selectively under nutrient-limiting (low glucose) conditions. Quantitative chemoproteomics identified MT-ND1, an integral membrane subunit of the ∼1 MDa NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex 1) involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as a specific target of the active probe. We further demonstrated that the active probe inhibits complex 1 activity in vitro (IC(50) = 720 nM), an effect that is known to induce cell death in low-glucose conditions. Based on this proof of principle study, we anticipate that the generation and integration of fully functionalized compound libraries into phenotypic screening programs should facilitate the discovery of bioactive probes that are amenable to accelerated target identification and mechanistic characterization using advanced chemoproteomic technologies.},

In addition to detecting well-characterized genes in the apoptosis pathway, we uncover several modulators including DOBI, a gene required for progression of the apoptotic signal through the intrinsic mitochondrial cell death pathway, and MIRSA, a gene that acts to limit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest a role for MYC and the WNT pathway in maintaining susceptibility to TRAIL.

Successful campaigns require physiological relevance, robust screening, and an ability to deconvolute perturbed pathways. High-content analysis (HCA) is increasingly used in cell biology and offers one approach to prosecution of phenotypic screens, but challenges exist in exploitation where data generated are high volume and complex. We combine development of an organotypic model with novel HCA tools to map phenotypic responses to pharmacological perturbations. We describe implementation for angiogenesis, a process that has long been a focus for therapeutic intervention but has lacked robust models that recapitulate more completely mechanisms involved. The study used human primary endothelial cells in co-culture with stromal fibroblasts to model multiple aspects of angiogenic signaling: cell interactions, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Multiple quantitative descriptors were derived from automated microscopy using custom-designed algorithms. Data were extracted using a bespoke informatics platform that integrates processing, statistics, and feature display into a streamlined workflow for building and interrogating fingerprints. Ninety compounds were characterized, defining mode of action by phenotype. Our approach for assessing phenotypic outcomes in complex assay models is robust and capable of supporting a range of phenotypic screens at scale.},

abstract = {Quantitative microscopy has proven a versatile and powerful phenotypic screening technique. Recently, image-based profiling has shown promise as a means for broadly characterizing molecules' effects on cells in several drug-discovery applications, including target-agnostic screening and predicting a compound's mechanism of action (MOA). Several profiling methods have been proposed, but little is known about their comparative performance, impeding the wider adoption and further development of image-based profiling. We compared these methods by applying them to a widely applicable assay of cultured cells and measuring the ability of each method to predict the MOA of a compendium of drugs. A very simple method that is based on population means performed as well as methods designed to take advantage of the measurements of individual cells. This is surprising because many treatments induced a heterogeneous phenotypic response across the cell population in each sample. Another simple method, which performs factor analysis on the cellular measurements before averaging them, provided substantial improvement and was able to predict MOA correctly for 94{\%} of the treatments in our ground-truth set. To facilitate the ready application and future development of image-based phenotypic profiling methods, we provide our complete ground-truth and test data sets, as well as open-source implementations of the various methods in a common software framework.},

abstract = {Germline determinants of gene expression in tumors are infrequently studied due to the complexity of transcript regulation caused by somatically acquired alterations. We performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-based analyses using the multi-level information provided in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Of the factors we measured, cis-acting eQTLs accounted for 1.2{\%} of the total variation of tumor gene expression, while somatic copy-number alteration and CpG methylation accounted for 7.3{\%} and 3.3{\%}, respectively. eQTL analyses of 15 previously reported breast cancer risk loci resulted in the discovery of three variants that are significantly associated with transcript levels (false discovery rate [FDR] {\textless} 0.1). Our trans-based analysis identified an additional three risk loci to act through ESR1, MYC, and KLF4. These findings provide a more comprehensive picture of gene expression determinants in breast cancer as well as insights into the underlying biology of breast cancer risk loci. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {GNRH significantly inhibits proliferation of a proportion of cancer cell lines by activating GNRH receptor (GNRHR)-G protein signaling. Therefore, manipulation of GNRHR signaling may have an under-utilized role in treating certain breast and ovarian cancers. However, the precise signaling pathways necessary for the effect and the features of cellular responses remain poorly defined. We used transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to characterize the effects of GNRHR activation in sensitive cells (HEK293-GNRHR, SCL60) in vitro and in vivo, compared to unresponsive HEK293. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated a dynamic response to the GNRH superagonist Triptorelin. Early and mid-phase changes (0.5-1.0 h) comprised mainly transcription factors. Later changes (8-24 h) included a GNRH target gene, CGA, and up- or downregulation of transcripts encoding signaling and cell division machinery. Pathway analysis identified altered MAPK and cell cycle pathways, consistent with occurrence of G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway gene transcripts were differentially expressed between control and Triptorelin-treated SCL60 cultures. Reverse-phase protein and phospho-proteomic array analyses profiled responses in cultured cells and SCL60 xenografts in vivo during Triptorelin anti-proliferation. Increased phosphorylated NF-$\kappa$B (p65) occurred in SCL60 in vitro, and p-NF-$\kappa$B and I$\kappa$B$\epsilon$ were higher in treated xenografts than controls after 4 days Triptorelin. NF-$\kappa$B inhibition enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of Triptorelin in SCL60 cultures. This study reveals details of pathways interacting with intense GNRHR signaling, identifies potential anti-proliferative target genes, and implicates the NF-$\kappa$B survival pathway as a node for enhancing GNRH agonist-induced anti-proliferation.},

abstract = {C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is known to regulate lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer stem cells. In breast cancer, CXCR4 signalling has been reported to be a mediator of metastasis, and is linked to poor prognosis. However its role in normal and malignant breast stem cell function has not been investigated. Anoikis resistant (AR) cells were collected from immortalised (MCF10A, 226L) and malignant (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3) breast cell lines and assessed for stem cell enrichment versus unsorted cells. AR cells had significantly higher mammosphere forming efficiency (MFE) than unsorted cells. The AR normal cells demonstrated increased formation of 3D structures in Matrigel compared to unsorted cells. In vivo, SKBR3 and T47D AR cells had 7- and 130-fold enrichments for tumour formationrespectively, compared with unsorted cells. AR cells contained significantly elevated CXCR4 transcript and protein levels compared to unsorted cells. Importantly, CXCR4 mRNA was higher in stem cell-enriched CD44+/CD24- patient-derived breast cancer cells compared to non-enriched cells. CXCR4 stimulation by its ligand SDF-1 reduced MFE of the normal breast cells lines but increased the MFE in T47D and patient-derived breast cancer cells. CXCR4 inhibition by AMD3100 increased stem cell activity but reduced the self-renewal capacity of the malignant breast cell line T47D. CXCR4+ FACS sorted MCF7 cells demonstrated a significantly increased MFE compared with CXCR4- cells. This significant increase in MFE was further demonstrated in CXCR4 over-expressing MCF7 cells which also had an increase in self-renewal compared to parental cells. A greater reduction in self-renewal following CXCR4 inhibition in the CXCR4 over-expressing cells compared with parental cells was also observed. Our data establish for the first time that CXCR4 signalling has contrasting effects on normal and malignant breast stem cell activity. Here, we demonstrate that CXCR4 signalling specifically regulates breast cancer stem cell activities and may therefore be important in tumour formation at the sites of metastases.},

abstract = {Kinase inhibitors have limited success in cancer treatment because tumors circumvent their action. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, and prevention of proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 inhibition, but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Tumor cells metastasize to distant organs through genetic and epigenetic alterations, including changes in microRNA (miR) expression. Here we find miR-22 triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhances invasiveness and promotes metastasis in mouse xenografts. In a conditional mammary gland-specific transgenic (TG) mouse model, we show that miR-22 enhances mammary gland side-branching, expands the stem cell compartment, and promotes tumor development. Critically, miR-22 promotes aggressive metastatic disease in MMTV-miR-22 TG mice, as well as compound MMTV-neu or -PyVT-miR-22 TG mice. We demonstrate that miR-22 exerts its metastatic potential by silencing antimetastatic miR-200 through direct targeting of the TET (Ten eleven translocation) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, thereby inhibiting demethylation of the mir-200 promoter. Finally, we show that miR-22 overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and silencing of the TET-miR-200 axis in patients. Taken together, our findings implicate miR-22 as a crucial epigenetic modifier and promoter of EMT and breast cancer stemness toward metastasis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Yes-associated protein (YAP1) is frequently reported to function as an oncogene in many types of cancer, but in breast cancer results remain controversial. We set out to clarify the role of YAP1 in breast cancer by examining gene and protein expression in subgroups of patient material and by downregulating YAP1 in vitro and studying its role in response to the widely used anti-estrogen tamoxifen.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: YAP1 protein intensity was scored as absent, weak, intermediate or strong in two primary breast cancer cohorts (n = 144 and n = 564) and mRNA expression of YAP1 was evaluated in a gene expression dataset (n = 1107). Recurrence-free survival was analysed using the log-rank test and Cox multivariate analysis was used to test for independence. WST-1 assay was employed to measure cell viability and a luciferase ERE (estrogen responsive element) construct was used to study the effect of tamoxifen, following downregulation of YAP1 using siRNAs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the ER+ (Estrogen Receptor $\alpha$ positive) subgroup of the randomised cohort, YAP1 expression was inversely correlated to histological grade and proliferation (p = 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively) whereas in the ER- (Estrogen Receptor $\alpha$ negative) subgroup YAP1 expression correlated positively to proliferation (p = 0.005). Notably, low YAP1 mRNA was independently associated with decreased recurrence-free survival in the gene expression dataset, specifically for the luminal A subgroup (p {\textless} 0.001) which includes low proliferating tumours of lower grade, usually associated with a good prognosis. This subgroup specificity led us to hypothesize that YAP1 may be important for response to endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, extensively used for luminal A breast cancers. In a tamoxifen randomised patient material, absent YAP1 protein expression was associated with impaired tamoxifen response which was significant upon interaction analysis (p = 0.042). YAP1 downregulation resulted in increased progesterone receptor (PgR) expression and a delayed and weaker tamoxifen in support of the clinical data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Decreased YAP1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in the less aggressive luminal A breast cancer subgroup, likely due to the decreased tamoxifen sensitivity conferred by YAP1 downregulation.},

abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) pathway is commonly activated in breast cancer and aberrations such as PI3K mutations are common. Recent exciting clinical trial results in advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER) breast cancer support mTOR activation is a major means of estrogen-independent tumor growth. Hence the means to identify a responsive breast cancer population that would most benefit from these compounds in the adjuvant or earlier stage setting is of high interest. Here we study PIK3CA genotype as well as a previously reported PI3K/mTOR-pathway gene signature (PIK3CA-GS) and their ability to estimate the level of PI3K pathway activation in two clinical trials of newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer patients- a total of 81 patients- one of which was randomized between letrozole and placebo vs letrozole and everolimus. The main objectives were to correlate the baseline PIK3CA genotype and GS with the relative change from baseline to day 15 in Ki67 (which has been shown to be prognostic in breast cancer) and phosphorylated S6 (S240) immunohistochemistry (a substrate of mTOR). In the randomized dataset, the PIK3CA-GS could identify those patients with the largest relative decreases in Ki67 to letrozole/everolimus (R = -0.43, p = 0.008) compared with letrozole/placebo (R = 0.07, p = 0.58; interaction test p = 0.02). In a second dataset of pre-surgical everolimus alone, the PIK3CA-GS was not significantly correlated with relative change in Ki67 (R = -0.11, p = 0.37) but with relative change in phosphorlyated S6 (S240) (R = -0.46, p = 0.028). PIK3CA genotype was not significantly associated with any endpoint in either datasets. Our results suggest that the PIK3CA-GS has potential to identify those ER-positive BCs who may benefit from the addition of everolimus to letrozole. Further evaluation of the PIK3CA-GS as a predictive biomarker is warranted as it may facilitate better selection of responsive patient populations for mTOR inhibition in combination with letrozole.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Wnt signalling has been implicated in stem cell regulation however its role in breast cancer stem cell regulation remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used a panel of normal and breast cancer cell lines to assess Wnt pathway gene and protein expression, and for the investigation of Wnt signalling within stem cell-enriched populations, mRNA and protein expression was analysed after the selection of anoikis-resistant cells. Finally, cell lines and patient-derived samples were used to investigate Wnt pathway effects on stem cell activity in vitro.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Wnt pathway signalling increased in cancer compared to normal breast and in both cell lines and patient samples, expression of Wnt pathway genes correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Furthermore, specific Wnt pathway genes were predictive for recurrence within subtypes of breast cancer. Canonical Wnt pathway genes were increased in breast cancer stem cell-enriched populations in comparison to normal breast stem cell-enriched populations. Furthermore in cell lines, the ligand Wnt3a increased whilst the inhibitor DKK1 reduced mammosphere formation with the greatest inhibitory effects observed in ER+ve breast cancer cell lines. In patient-derived metastatic breast cancer samples, only ER-ve mammospheres were responsive to the ligand Wnt3a. However, the inhibitor DKK1 efficiently inhibited both ER+ve and ER-ve breast cancer but not normal mammosphere formation, suggesting that the Wnt pathway is aberrantly activated in breast cancer mammospheres.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data highlight differential Wnt signalling in breast cancer subtypes and activity in patient-derived metastatic cancer stem-like cells indicating a potential for Wnt-targeted treatment in breast cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrant CpG island promoter DNA hypermethylation is frequently observed in cancer and is believed to contribute to tumor progression by silencing the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Previously, we observed that promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer reflects cell lineage rather than tumor progression and occurs at genes that are already repressed in a lineage-specific manner. To investigate the generality of our observation we analyzed the methylation profiles of 1,154 cancers from 7 different tissue types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We find that 1,009 genes are prone to hypermethylation in these 7 types of cancer. Nearly half of these genes varied in their susceptibility to hypermethylation between different cancer types. We show that the expression status of hypermethylation prone genes in the originator tissue determines their propensity to become hypermethylated in cancer; specifically, genes that are normally repressed in a tissue are prone to hypermethylation in cancers derived from that tissue. We also show that the promoter regions of hypermethylation-prone genes are depleted of repetitive elements and that DNA sequence around the same promoters is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that these two characteristics reflect tissue-specific gene promoter architecture regulating the expression of these hypermethylation prone genes in normal tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: As aberrantly hypermethylated genes are already repressed in pre-cancerous tissue, we suggest that their hypermethylation does not directly contribute to cancer development via silencing. Instead aberrant hypermethylation reflects developmental history and the perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms maintaining these repressed promoters in a hypomethylated state in normal cells.},

abstract = {Proteomic profiling of the estrogen/tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cell line and its partially sensitive (MCF-7/LCC1) and fully resistant (MCF-7/LCC9) variants was performed to identify modifiers of endocrine sensitivity in breast cancer. Analysis of the expression of 120 paired phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated epitopes in key oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways revealed that STAT1 and several phosphorylated epitopes (phospho-STAT1(Tyr701) and phospho-STAT3(Ser727)) were differentially expressed between endocrine resistant and parental controls, confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The STAT1 inhibitor EGCG was a more effective inhibitor of the endocrine resistant MCF-7/LCC1 and MCF-7/LCC9 lines than parental MCF-7 cells, while STAT3 inhibitors Stattic and WP1066 were equally effective in endocrine-resistant and parental lines. The effects of the STAT inhibitors were additive, rather than synergistic, when tested in combination with tamoxifen in vitro. Expression of STAT1 and STAT3 were measured by quantitative immunofluorescence in invasive breast cancers and matched lymph nodes. When lymph node expression was compared to its paired primary breast cancer expression, there was greater expression of cytoplasmic STAT1 (∼3.1 fold), phospho-STAT3(Ser727) (∼1.8 fold), and STAT5 (∼1.5 fold) and nuclear phospho-STAT3(Ser727) (∼1.5 fold) in the nodes. Expression levels of STAT1 and STAT3 transcript were analysed in 550 breast cancers from publicly available gene expression datasets (GSE2990, GSE12093, GSE6532). When treatment with tamoxifen was considered, STAT1 gene expression was nearly predictive of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, log-rank p = 0.067), while STAT3 gene expression was predictive of DMFS (log-rank p{\textless}0.0001). Analysis of STAT1 and STAT3 protein expression in a series of 546 breast cancers also indicated that high expression of STAT3 protein was associated with improved survival (DMFS, p = 0.006). These results suggest that STAT signaling is important in endocrine resistance, and that STAT inhibitors may represent potential therapies in breast cancer, even in the resistant setting.},

abstract = {3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5{\&}prime;-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.},

@article{Hastie2005a,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {High-throughput screening is an early critical step in drug discovery. Its aim is to screen a large number of diverse chemical compounds to identify candidate 'hits' rapidly and accurately. Few statistical tools are currently available, however, to detect quality hits with a high degree of confidence. We examine statistical aspects of data preprocessing and hit identification for primary screens. We focus on concerns related to positional effects of wells within plates, choice of hit threshold and the importance of minimizing false-positive and false-negative rates. We argue that replicate measurements are needed to verify assumptions of current methods and to suggest data analysis strategies when assumptions are not met. The integration of replicates with robust statistical methods in primary screens will facilitate the discovery of reliable hits, ultimately improving the sensitivity and specificity of the screening process.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},
