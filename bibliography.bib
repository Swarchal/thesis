abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Attempts to reduce the number of efficacy- and safety-related failures by analysing possible links to the physicochemical properties of small-molecule drug candidates have been inconclusive because of the limited size of data sets from individual companies. Here, we describe the compilation and analysis of combined data on the attrition of drug candidates from AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The analysis reaffirms that control of physicochemical properties during compound optimization is beneficial in identifying compounds of candidate drug quality and indicates for the first time a link between the physicochemical properties of compounds and clinical failure due to safety issues. The results also suggest that further control of physicochemical properties is unlikely to have a significant effect on attrition rates and that additional work is required to address safety-related failures. Further cross-company collaborations will be crucial to future progress in this area.},

Emerging knowledge of the normal breast cell types has led to the hypothesis that the subtypes of breast cancer might arise from mutations or genetic rearrangements occurring in different populations of stem cells and progenitor cells. We describe the common distinguishing features of these breast cancer subtypes and explain how these features relate both to prognosis and to selection of the most appropriate therapy. Recent data indicate that breast tumors may originate from cancer stem cells. Consequently, inhibition of stem-cell self-renewal pathways should be explored because of the likelihood that residual stem cells might be resistant to current therapies.},

However, currently available imaging approaches employed in high-throughput screening drug discovery platforms e.g. bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopies, are unable to resolve 3D structures deep inside ({\textgreater}50 $\mu$m) tumor spheroids. In this study, we established a label-free, non-invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging platform to characterize 3D morphological and physiological information of multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) growing from {\~{}}250 $\mu$m up to {\~{}}600 $\mu$m in height over 21 days. In particular, tumor spheroids of two cell lines glioblastoma (U-87 MG) and colorectal carcinoma (HCT 116) exhibited distinctive evolutions in their geometric shapes at late growth stages. Volumes of MCTS were accurately quantified using a voxel-based approach without presumptions of their geometries. In contrast, conventional diameter-based volume calculations assuming perfect spherical shape resulted in large quantification errors. Furthermore, we successfully detected necrotic regions within these tumor spheroids based on increased intrinsic optical attenuation, suggesting a promising alternative of label-free viability tests in tumor spheroids. Therefore, OCT can serve as a promising imaging modality to characterize morphological and physiological features of MCTS, showing great potential for high-throughput drug screening.},

abstract = {The traditional method for studying cancer in vitro is to grow immortalized cancer cells in two-dimensional monolayers on plastic. However, many cellular features are impaired in these artificial conditions, and large changes in gene expression compared to tumors have been reported. Three-dimensional cell culture models have become increasingly popular and are suggested to be better models than two-dimensional monolayers due to improved cell-to-cell contact and structures that resemble in vivo architecture. The aim of this study was to develop a simple high-throughput three-dimensional drug screening method and to compare drug responses in JIMT1 breast cancer cells when grown in two dimensions, in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) induced anchorage-independent three-dimensional models, and in Matrigel three-dimensional cell culture models. We screened 102 compounds with multiple concentrations and biological replicates for their effects on cell proliferation. The cells were either treated immediately upon plating, or they were allowed to grow in three-dimensional cultures for 4 days before the drug treatment. Large variations in drug responses were observed between the models indicating that comparisons of culture model-influenced drug sensitivities cannot be made based on the effects of a single drug. However, we show with the 63 most prominent drugs that, in general, JIMT1 cells grown on Matrigel were significantly more sensitive to drugs than cells grown in two-dimensional cultures, while the responses of cells grown in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) resembled those of the two-dimensional cultures. Furthermore, comparing the gene expression profiles of the cell culture models to xenograft tumors indicated that cells cultured in Matrigel and as xenografts most closely resembled each other. In this study, we also suggest that three-dimensional cultures can provide a platform for systematic experimentation of larger compound collections in a high-throughput mode and be used as alternatives to traditional two-dimensional screens for better comparability to the in vivo state.},

To enable assessment of differential perturbagen impacts on cell growth in 2D and 3D, we have miniaturized and adapted for high-throughput screening (HTS) the soft agar colony formation assay, employing a laser-scanning cytometer to image and quantify multiple cell types simultaneously. The assay is HTS compatible, providing high-quality, image-based, replicable data for multiple, co-cultured cell types. As proof of concept, we subjected colorectal carcinoma colonies in 3D soft agar to a mini screen of 1528 natural product compounds. Hit compounds from the primary screen were rescreened in an HTS 3D co-culture matrix containing colon stromal cells and cancer cells. By combining tumor cells and normal, nontransformed colon epithelial cells in one primary screening assay, we were able to obtain differential IC50 data, thereby distinguishing tumor-specific compounds from general cytotoxic compounds. Moreover, we were able to identify compounds that antagonized tumor colony formation in 3D only, highlighting the importance of this assay in identifying agents that interfere with 3D tumor structural growth. This screening platform provides a fast, simple, and robust method for identification of tumor-specific agents in a biologically relevant microenvironment.},

This model aims to exploit the potential of 3D cell culture as a screening tool for novel therapeutics for discovery programs. Here we have evaluated a Matrigel™ based induction of 3D tumor formation using standard labware and plate reading equipment. We have demonstrated that with an optimized protocol, reproducible proliferation, and cell viability data can be obtained across a range of cell lines and reagent batches. A panel of reference drugs was used to validate the suitability of the assays for a high throughput drug discovery program. Indicators of assay reproducibility, such as Z'-factor and coefficient of variation, as well as dose response curves confirmed the robustness of the assays. Several methods of drug activity determination were examined, including metabolic and imaging based assays. These data demonstrate this model as a robust tool for drug discovery bridging the gap between monolayer cell culture and animal models, providing insights into drug efficacy at an earlier time point, ultimately reducing costs and high attrition rates.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture techniques are frequently used to model alterations in tissue architecture critically important for tumor development. Here, we report on a detailed comparison of a spheroid model of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) overexpressing cancer cells with the traditional monolayer culture. In 2D culture, HER2 and HER3 form heterodimers, whereas in multicellular spheroids HER2 homodimers are formed. These homodimers localize in membrane rafts, resulting in enhanced inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cells with trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting HER2. Within the tumor spheroids, HER2 homodimerization leads to enhanced activation of HER2 and results in a switch in signaling pathways from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Diminished PI3K signaling is accompanied by the activation of the integrin beta4/Rac1/PAK 2 signaling cascade. We propose that the described 3D culture system may better reflect some in vivo aspects of HER signaling and can be used to further improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of trastuzumab action. Furthermore, the described human multicellular tumor spheroids may allow identification of new targets for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer patients who currently benefit suboptimally from trastuzumab treatment.},

Growing cells as three-dimensional (3D) models more analogous to their existence in vivo, for example, akin to a tumour, and possibly co-cultured with other cells and cellular components that naturally occur in their microenvironment may be more clinically relevant.

Particularly, the repurposing of drugs with known safety profiles in children could bypass or streamline toxicity studies. We employed a phenotypic screening paradigm on a panel of well-characterized cell lines derived from pediatric solid tumors against a collection of {\~{}}3,800 compounds spanning approved drugs and investigational agents. Specifically, we employed titration-based screening where compounds were tested at multiple concentrations for their effect on cell viability. Molecular and cellular target enrichment analysis indicated that numerous agents across different therapeutic categories and modes of action had an antiproliferative effect, notably antiparasitic/protozoal drugs with non-classic antineoplastic activity. Focusing on active compounds with dosing and safety information in children according to the Children{\&}rsquo;s Pharmacy Collaborative database, we identified compounds with therapeutic potential through further validation using 3D tumor spheroid models. Moreover, we show that antiparasitic agents induce cell death  via  apoptosis induction. This study demonstrates that our screening platform enables the identification of chemical agents with cytotoxic activity in pediatric cancer cell lines of which many have known safety/toxicity profiles in children. These agents constitute attractive candidates for efficacy studies in pre-clinical models of pediatric solid tumors.},

This screening model was rapidly recognized as a rich source of information about the mechanisms of growth inhibition and tumour-cell kill. Recently, its role has changed to that of a service screen supporting the cancer research community. Here I review the development, use and productivity of the screen, highlighting several outcomes that have contributed to advances in cancer chemotherapy.},

Analyses of genome-wide gene expression levels offer a first glance at which genes and pathways are affected in cell lines as compared to their tissues of origins. We have summarized available gene expression data and review how cell lines adapt to in vitro environments, to what degree they express markers of their tissues of origins and discuss how cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) cultures may have more physiological interactions with neighbouring cells and extracellular matrix. We will also discuss the interplay between malignant cells and stroma present in tumours but lacking in cell lines and how these differences might affect gene expression comparisons of cell lines to tumours. A model simulating impact of stromal cells on gene expression profiles is presented. Understanding the transcriptomes of cells grown in 2D and 3D cultures and how they compare to those of in vivo cells are important for improving cell line model systems and for the reconstituting of tissues in vitro. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, these cell lines have been intensely investigated, providing a unique platform for hypothesis-driven research focused on enhancing our understanding of tumor biology. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of coding variants in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines identified by whole exome sequencing, providing a list of possible cancer specific variants for the community. Furthermore, we identify pharmacogenomic correlations between specific variants in genes such as TP53, BRAF, ERBBs, and ATAD5 and anticancer agents such as nutlin, vemurafenib, erlotinib, and bleomycin showing one of many ways the data could be used to validate and generate novel hypotheses for further investigation. As new cancer genes are identified through large-scale sequencing studies, the data presented here for the NCI-60 will be an invaluable resource for identifying cell lines with mutations in such genes for hypothesis-driven research.

As CCL panels continue to grow in size and diversity, many polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters and drug targets, as well as disease-related genes have been linked to altered drug sensitivity. However, identifying the correlation between this variability and pharmacological responses remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of cancer biology and the intricate interplay between cell lines and drug molecules. Here, we propose a network-based strategy that exploits information on gene expression and somatic mutations of CCLs to group cells according to their molecular similarity. We then identify genes that are characteristic of each cluster and correlate their status with drug response. We find that CCLs with similar characteristic active network regions present specific responses to certain drugs, and identify a limited set of genes that might be directly involved in drug sensitivity or resistance.},

abstract = {Despite the millions of dollars spent on target validation and drug optimization in preclinical models, most therapies still fail in phase III clinical trials. Our current model systems, or the way we interpret data from them, clearly do not have sufficient clinical predictive power. Current opinion suggests that this is because the cell lines and xenografts that are commonly used are inadequate models that do not effectively mimic and predict human responses. This has become such a widespread belief that it approaches dogma in the field of drug discovery and optimization and has spurred a surge in studies devoted to the development of more sophisticated animal models such as orthotopic patient-derived xenografts in an attempt to obtain more accurate estimates of whether particular cancers will respond to given treatments. Here, we explore the evidence that has led to the move away from the use of in vitro cell lines and toward various forms of xenograft models for drug screening and development. We review some of the pros and cons of each model and give an overview of ways in which the use of cell lines could be modified to improve the predictive capacity of this well-defined model.},

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

We applied SPADE to flow cytometry data of mouse bone marrow and to mass cytometry data of human bone marrow. In both cases, SPADE organized cells in a hierarchy of related phenotypes that partially recapitulated well-described patterns of hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that SPADE is robust to measurement noise and to the choice of cellular markers.

A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning-based primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by ≈50{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: By identifying known drugs as potential therapeutics for CCM, we have decreased the time, cost, and risk of bringing treatments to patients. Each drug also prompts additional exploration of biomarkers of CCM disease.

abstract = {Motivation: Identifying phenotypes based on high-content cellular images is challenging. Conventional image analysis pipelines for phenotype identification comprise multiple independent steps, with each step requiring method customization and adjustment of multiple parameters. Results: Here we present an approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network (M-CNN) that classifies, in a single cohesive step, cellular images into phenotypes by using directly and solely the images' pixel intensity values. The only parameters in the approach are the weights of the neural network, which are automatically optimized based on training images. The approach requires no a priori knowledge or manual customization, and is applicable to single-or multi-channel images displaying single or multiple cells. We evaluated the classification performance of the approach on eight diverse benchmark datasets. The approach yielded overall a higher classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art results, including those of other deep CNN architectures. In addition to using the network to simply obtain a yes-or-no prediction for a given phenotype, we use the probability outputs calculated by the network to quantitatively describe the phenotypes. Our study shows that these probability values correlate with chemical treatment concentrations. This finding validates further our approach and enables chemical treatment potency estimation via convolutional neural networks. Availability: The network specifications and solver definitions are provided in Supplementary Software 1.},

Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns.

Existing work in out- lier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real- world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding lo- cal outliers can be practical.},

In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

abstract = {Gene expression microarrays are widely used to better understand the complex$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbiological mechanisms inside cells. One of the main obstacles of applying statistical$\backslash$r$\backslash$nlearning algorithms to microarray data is the large gap between the number of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfeatures (p) and the number of available instances (n), i.e., the “large p, small n”$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchallenge. This thesis explores two ways to deal with this challenge.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nOne approach is to increase n by combining similarly appropriate microarray$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata sets together. This is appealing as there are now many publicly available$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmicroarray studies. The main problem of this approach is the batch effect, i.e., the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninfluence of non-biological factors on expression intensities that can confound the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbiological signal. As a result, combining gene expression studies without correcting$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfor batch effects may lead to misleading findings.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis thesis proposes a novel batch correction algorithm, called batch effect correction$\backslash$r$\backslash$nusing canonical correlation analysis (BECCA), that assumes the batch effect$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis due to additive independent confounding factors and so utilizes canonical$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncorrelation analysis to separate technical bias from the measured biological signal.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nWe compare BECCA to various existing batch correction algorithms using several$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreal-world gene expression studies and find that BECCA has similar performance.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe key advantage of utilizing BECCA, compared to other similar performing algorithms,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis its flexibility, as BECCA allows the user to adjust how much common$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsignal to preserve across the batches and how much batch related signal to remove$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom each one by changing the values of BECCA parameters.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe second approach to batch correction considers the wisdom of reducing p by$\backslash$r$\backslash$nselecting a subset of genes. Our experiments suggest that some genes in microarray$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata sets contain very little biological signal, i.e., including only these genes in the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncalculations makes all specimens highly correlated, regardless of their tissue of origin$\backslash$r$\backslash$nor disease state. It is, therefore, desirable to identify and remove these misleading$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngenes before conducing downstream analysis or batch correction. For this purpose,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwe propose an efficient algorithm to extend the single-study variance-based gene$\backslash$r$\backslash$nselection method to a multi-study gene selection algorithm. Our empirical results$\backslash$r$\backslash$nshow this feature selection algorithm outperforms other algorithms in reducing the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndestructive influence of batch effects.},

The feature values are then used to classify test images into a set of pre-defined image classes. This classifier was tested on several different problems including biological image classification and face recognition. Although we cannot make a claim of universality, our experimental results show that this classifier performs as well or better than classifiers developed specifically for these image classification tasks. Our classifier's high performance on a variety of classification problems is attributed to (i) a large set of features extracted from images; and (ii) an effective feature selection and weighting algorithm sensitive to specific image classification problems.

Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.},

As experiments can produce large numbers of high bit depth images, automated processing methods have become necessary for handling these data sets. Thresholding, whereby a high bit depth image is converted into a binary image in order to identify a feature of interest, is one such standard automated technique; but the method of selecting an appropriate threshold value is far from standard. We present a novel algorithm, maximum correlation thresholding (MCT), that thresholds images accurately and efficiently without relying on any assumptions of the statistics of the image. As MCT produces thresholded images that preserve the most salient elements in the image, the algorithm performs as well as a trained user on a range of neurobiological data and in a variety of noisy conditions or when preprocessing steps preceded the thresholding operation. Our method will thus allow neuroscientists to automate image thresholding using a robust, computationally efficient algorithm, ultimately aiding in accurate image quantification and analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

It seems unlikely that Deep Nets in their current form will be the best long-term solution either for building general purpose intelligent machines or for understanding the mind/brain, but it is likely that many aspects of them will remain. At present Deep Nets do very well on specific types of visual tasks and on specific benchmarked datasets. But Deep Nets are much less general purpose, flexible, and adaptive than the human visual system. Moreover, methods like Deep Nets may run into fundamental difficulties when faced with the enormous complexity of natural images. To illustrate our main points, while keeping the references small, this paper is slightly biased towards work from our group.},

abstract = {Significantly improved crop varieties are urgently needed to feed the rapidly growing human population under changing climates. While genome sequence information and excellent genomic tools are in place for major crop species, the systematic quantification of phenotypic traits or components thereof in a high-throughput fashion remains an enormous challenge. In order to help bridge the genotype to phenotype gap, we developed a comprehensive framework for highthroughput phenotype data analysis in plants, which enables the extraction of an extensive list of phenotypic traits from nondestructive plant imaging over time. As a proof of concept, we investigated the phenotypic components of the drought responses of 18 different barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivars during vegetative growth. We analyzed dynamic properties of trait expression over growth time based on 54 representative phenotypic features. The data are highly valuable to understand plant development and to further quantify growth and crop performance features. We tested various growth models to predict plant biomass accumulation and identified several relevant parameters that support biological interpretation of plant growth and stress tolerance. These image-based traits and model-derived parameters are promising for subsequent genetic mapping to uncover the genetic basis of complex agronomic traits. Taken together, we anticipate that the analytical framework and analysis results presented here will be useful to advance our views of phenotypic trait components underlying plant development and their responses to environmental cues.},

abstract = {Symmetric, dimeric daclatasvir (BMS-790052) is the clinical lead for a class of picomolar inhibitors of HCV replication. While specific, resistance-bearing mutations at positions 31 and 93 of domain I strongly suggest the viral NS5A as target, structural mechanism(s) for the drugs' activities and resistance remains unclear. Several previous models suggested symmetric binding modes relative to the homodimeric target; however, none can fully explain SAR details for this class. We present semiautomated workflows to model potential receptor conformations for docking. Surprisingly, ranking docked hits with our library-derived 3D-pharmacophore revealed two distinct asymmetric binding modes, at a conserved poly-proline region between 31 and 93, consistent with SAR. Interfering with protein-protein interactions at this membrane interface can explain potent inhibition of replication-complex formation, resistance, effects on lipid droplet distribution, and virion release. These detailed interaction models and proposed mechanisms of action will allow structure-based design of new NS5A directed compounds with higher barriers to HCV resistance.},

abstract = {To examine the mechanism by which metformin lowers endogenous glucose production in type 2 diabetic patients, we studied seven type 2 diabetic subjects, with fasting hyperglycemia (15.5 +/- 1.3 mmol/l), before and after 3 months of metformin treatment. Seven healthy subjects, matched for sex, age, and BMI, served as control subjects. Rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis, estimated by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were combined with estimates of contributions to glucose production of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, measured by labeling of blood glucose by 2H from ingested 2H2O. Glucose production was measured using [6,6-2H2]glucose. The rate of glucose production was twice as high in the diabetic subjects as in control subjects (0.70 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) min(-1), P {\textless} 0.0001). Metformin reduced that rate by 24{\%} (to 0.53 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.0009) and fasting plasma glucose concentration by 30{\%} (to 10.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/l, P = 0.0002). The rate of gluconeogenesis was three times higher in the diabetic subjects than in the control subjects (0.59 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) min(-1) and metformin reduced that rate by 36{\%} (to 0.38 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.01). By the 2H2O method, there was a twofold increase in rates of gluconeogenesis in diabetic subjects (0.42 +/- 0.04 mmol m(-2) x min(-1), which decreased by 33{\%} after metformin treatment (0.28 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.0002). There was no glycogen cycling in the control subjects, but in the diabetic subjects, glycogen cycling contributed to 25{\%} of glucose production and explains the differences between the two methods used. In conclusion, patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes have increased rates of endogenous glucose production, which can be attributed to increased rates of gluconeogenesis. Metformin lowered the rate of glucose production in these patients through a reduction in gluconeogenesis.},

HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitors are pan-genotypic in spectrum, and this mechanistic class provides the most potent HCV inhibitors in vitro that have been described to date. Clinical trials with 6 demonstrated a potent effect on reducing plasma viral load and, in combination with mechanistically orthogonal HCV inhibitors, established the ability to cure even the most difficult infections without the need for immune stimulation.

Machine learning algorithms applied to those data sets most often are used to provide predictions without interpretation, or reveal single drug-gene association and fail to derive robust insights. We propose to use Macau, a bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the association between the drug targets and signaling pathway activations. A typical insight would be: Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X. We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using signaling pathways' activities as cell line input and nominal targets as drug input. The interactions between the drug target and the pathway activity can guide a tissue specific treatment strategy by for example suggesting how to modulate a certain protein to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues. Such an analysis of interactions across tissues might help drug repurposing and patient stratification strategies.},

abstract = {High cancer drug development attrition rates have provoked considerable debate about whether the two-dimensional tumor growth inhibition high-throughput screening assays used in pre-clinical lead discovery adequately reflect solid tumor complexity. We used automated high-content screening image acquisition and analysis methods to compare fluorescent drug uptake, accumulation, and distribution in Cal33 and FaDu head and neck cancer (HNC) monolayer and multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) models. Ellipticine, idarubicin, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin were studied because of their fluorescent properties and broad anti-tumor activities. HNC MCTSs were generated in 384-well ultra-low attachment plates where compound exposure, image acquisition, and analysis could be performed in situ. Fluorescent drug accumulation in Cal33 monolayer and MCTS cultures was linear with respect to concentration, and appeared to achieve steady-state levels within 10-15 min of drug exposure, which were maintained through 30-45 min. Drug accumulation in monolayers was independent of cell number and/or density, and every cell achieved uniform drug concentrations. In MCTSs, however, drug accumulation increased as the number of cells and sizes of the MCTSs became bigger. Drugs exhibited restricted penetration and distribution gradients, accumulating preferentially in cells in the outer layers of MCTSs relative to those in the inner cores. Cal33 monolayers were 6-, 20-, 10-, and 16-fold more sensitive than MCTSs to growth inhibition by ellipticine, idarubicin, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, respectively. In Cal33 MCTSs exposed to ellipticine or doxorubicin for 24 h, MCTSs were smaller and although they still exhibited drug penetration and distribution gradients, the fluorescent intensity difference between outer and inner cells was reduced. After a 24 h exposure, both drugs had penetrated throughout FaDu MCTSs, consistent with drug-induced death of peripheral cell layers enhancing drug penetration. The increased resistance of MCTS cultures and their ability to recapitulate drug penetration and distribution gradients argues strongly for the deployment of these more physiological models in cancer lead discovery. MCTSs have the potential to enhance the correlation between in vitro potencies and in vivo efficacy, and ultimately may lead to improved cancer drug approval rates.},

This information can now be exploited by using machine-learning approaches for both image segmentation and the classification of objects. We have combined these approaches with a label-free assay for growth and differentiation of leukemic colonies, to generate a novel platform for phenotypic drug discovery. Initially, a supervised machine-learning algorithm was used to identify in-focus colonies growing in a three-dimensional (3D) methylcellulose gel. Once identified, unsupervised clustering and principle component analysis of texture-based phenotypic profiles were applied to group similar phenotypes. In a proof-of-concept study, we successfully identified a novel phenotype induced by a compound that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia. We believe that our platform will be of great benefit for the utilization of patient-derived 3D cell...},

abstract = {A major roadblock in the effective treatment of cancers is their heterogeneity, whereby multiple molecular landscapes are classified as a single disease. To explore the contribution of cellular metabolism to cancer heterogeneity, we analyse the Metabric dataset, a landmark genomic and transcriptomic study of 2,000 individual breast tumours, in the context of the human genome-scale metabolic network. We create personalized metabolic landscapes for each tumour by exploring sets of active reactions that satisfy constraints derived from human biochemistry and maximize congruency with the Metabric transcriptome data. Classification of the personalized landscapes derived from 997 tumour samples within the Metabric discovery dataset reveals a novel poor prognosis cluster, reproducible in the 995-sample validation dataset. We experimentally follow mechanistic hypotheses resulting from the computational study and establish that active serotonin production is a major metabolic feature of the poor prognosis group. These data support the reconsideration of concomitant serotonin-specific uptake inhibitors treatment during breast cancer chemotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a high risk of relapse and there are few chemotherapy options. Although 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) signaling pathways have been suggested as potential targets for anti-cancer drug development, the mechanism responsible for the action of 5-HT in TNBC remains unknown. METHODS Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution. siRNA transfection was used to assess involvement of genes in cancer invasion, which were identified by Matrigel transwell invasion assay. Levels of 5-HT and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured using ELISA kits. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and mouse tumor model were used to investigate the in vivo effects of SB269970, a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and BJ-1113, a novel synthetic compound. RESULTS TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC-1395, and Hs578T) expressed higher levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) than hormone-responsive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D). In MDA-MB-231 cells, 5-HT promoted invasion and proliferation via 5-HT7 receptor, and interestingly, the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was stronger than its effect on proliferation. Likewise, downstream signaling pathways of 5-HT7 differed during invasion and proliferation, that is, G$\alpha$-activated cAMP and G$\beta$$\gamma$-activated kinase signaling during invasion, and G$\beta$$\gamma$-activated PI3K/Akt signaling during proliferation. Also, 5-HT increased the protein expressions of TPH1 and VEGF in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results provide insight of the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on breast cancer progression; 5-HT was found to act more strongly during the first stage of metastasis (during invasion and migration) than during the later proliferative phase after local invasion. Interestingly, these actions of 5-HT were inhibited by BJ-1113, a 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol analog. BJ-1113 blocked intracellular signaling pathways initiated by 5-HT7 receptor activation, and exhibited anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activities against MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of BJ-1113 against MDA-MB-231 tumor growth was greater than that of SB269970, a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS 5-HT7 receptor which mediates 5-HT-induced cancer progression is a potential therapeutic target in TNBC, and BJ-1113 offers a novel scaffold for the development of anti-cancer agents against TNBC.},

Dysregulation of serotonin signaling is reported to contribute to breast cancer pathophysiology by enhancing cell proliferation and promoting resistance to apoptosis. Preliminary analyses indicated that the potent 5-HT1B/1D serotonin receptor agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT), a triptan-like molecule, induced cell death in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, we synthesized a series of novel alkyloxytryptamine analogues, several of which decreased the viability of various human cancer cell lines. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses showed that compounds 6 and 10 induced apoptosis and interfered with signaling pathways that regulate protein translation and survival, such as the Akt/mTOR pathway, in triple-negative breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {The paradigm of molecular histopathology is shifting from a single-marker immunohistochemistry towards multiplexed detection of markers to better understand the complex pathological processes. However, there are no systems allowing multiplexed IHC (mIHC) with high-resolution whole-slide tissue imaging and analysis, yet providing feasible throughput for routine use. We present an mIHC platform combining fluorescent and chromogenic staining with automated whole-slide imaging and integrated whole-slide image analysis, enabling simultaneous detection of six protein markers and nuclei, and automatic quantification and classification of hundreds of thousands of cells in situ in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. In the first proof-of-concept, we detected immune cells at cell-level resolution (n = 128,894 cells) in human prostate cancer, and analysed T cell subpopulations in different tumour compartments (epithelium vs. stroma). In the second proof-of-concept, we demonstrated an automatic classification of epithelial cell populations (n = 83,558) and glands (benign vs. cancer) in prostate cancer with simultaneous analysis of androgen receptor (AR) and alpha-methylacyl-CoA (AMACR) expression at cell-level resolution. We conclude that the open-source combination of 8-plex mIHC detection, whole-slide image acquisition and analysis provides a robust tool allowing quantitative, spatially resolved whole-slide tissue cytometry directly in formalin-fixed human tumour tissues for improved characterization of histology and the tumour microenvironment.},

abstract = {Phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) approaches do not rely on knowledge of the identity of a specific drug target or a hypothesis about its role in disease, in contrast to the target-based strategies that have been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry in the past three decades. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence in interest in PDD approaches based on their potential to address the incompletely understood complexity of diseases and their promise of delivering first-in-class drugs, as well as major advances in the tools for cell-based phenotypic screening. Nevertheless, PDD approaches also have considerable challenges, such as hit validation and target deconvolution. This article focuses on the lessons learned by researchers engaged in PDD in the pharmaceutical industry and considers the impact of ‘omics' knowledge in defining a cellular disease phenotype in the era of precision medicine, introducing the concept of a chain of translatability. We particularly aim to identify features and areas in which PDD can best deliver value to drug discovery portfolios and can contribute to the identification and the development of novel medicines, and to illustrate the challenges and uncertainties that are associated with PDD in order to help set realistic expectations with regard to its benefits and costs.},

abstract = {Today, novel therapeutics are identified in an environment which is intrinsically different from the clinical context in which they are ultimately evaluated. Using molecular phenotyping and an in vitro model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, we show that by quantifying pathway reporter gene expression, molecular phenotyping can cluster compounds based on pathway profiles and dissect associations between pathway activities and disease phenotypes simultaneously. Molecular phenotyping was applicable to compounds with a range of binding specificities and triaged false positives derived from high-content screening assays. The technique identified a class of calcium-signaling modulators that can reverse disease-regulated pathways and phenotypes, which was validated by structurally distinct compounds of relevant classes. Our results advocate for application of molecular phenotyping in early drug discovery, promoting biological relevance as a key selection criterion early in the drug development cascade. Drawnel and Zhang et al. show that quantitative mRNA sequencing of pathway reporter genes can be powered by translational information and classifies compound responses. Adopting this technique in drug discovery could permit biomedically relevant compound screening, increasing likelihood of clinical impact.},

Emerging potential solutions to this challenge include the exploration of cancer genome dynamic evolution in time and space. Breakthrough next-generation sequencing (NGS) applications including multiregional NGS for intratumor heterogeneity identification, repeated cell-free DNA/circulating tumor DNA-NGS for detecting circulating genomic subclones and their comparison to reveal intrapatient heterogeneity (IPH) could identify the dynamic emergence of resistant subclones in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic setting. Based on genome-phenotype map, and potential promising findings, rigorous evaluation of IPH spatiotemporal evolution and early drug development concepts in innovative clinical trials could dramatically speed up the translational process to achieve clinical precision oncology. Understanding and identifying the dynamic emergence of the druggable mutational and molecular landscape in response to therapy following Darwinian evolution creates the foundation of precision oncology to overcome therapeutic resistance.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal disease causing progressive loss of motor neurons, still has no effective treatment. We developed a phenotypic screen to repurpose existing drugs using ALS motor neuron survival as readout.Motor neuronswere generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from anALS patientwith amutation in superoxidedismutase 1 (SOD1). Results of the screen showed that more than half of the hits targeted the Src/c-Abl signaling pathway. Src/c-Abl inhibitors increased survival of ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons in vitro. Knockdown of Src or c-Abl with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) also rescued ALS motor neuron degeneration. One of the hits, bosutinib, boosted autophagy, reduced the amount of misfolded mutant SOD1 protein, and attenuated altered expression ofmitochondrial genes. Bosutinib also increased survival in vitro of ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons frompatients with sporadic ALS or other forms of familialALS caused by mutations in TARDNAbinding protein (TDP-43) or repeat expansions in C9orf72. Furthermore, bosutinib treatmentmodestly extended survival of amousemodel of ALSwith an SOD1mutation, suggesting that Src/c-Ablmay be a potentially useful target for developing new drugs to treat ALS.},

@article{Dizeyi2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increase in the number of serotonin (5-HT) releasing neuroendocrine (NE) cells has been shown to be correlated with tumor progression, loss of androgen dependence, and poor prognosis. Serotonin is a well-known mitogen which mediates a wide variety of physiological effects via multiple receptors, of which receptor subtype 1 (5-HTR1) has been identified in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. Recently, 5-HT has been found to show growth-promoting activity and to be functionally related to oncogenes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Localization, protein content, and mRNA expression of 5-HTR subtype 1A, 1B, and 1D was studied in prostatic tissue (35 patients), metastases, PC cell lines, a benign prostatic stromal cell line (human prostate cell preparation (hPCP)), and xenografts of PC-3 cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting, and RT-PCR, respectively. The growth-inhibition effect of a 5-HT1A antagonist (NAN-190) on PC cell lines was studied using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. RESULTS: A strong immunoreaction of 5-HTR1A and 1B was demonstrated in high-grade tumor cells (35/35) and a small number of BPH cells, whereas 5-HTR1D was confined to vascular endothelial cells. 5-HTR1A was also demonstrated in PC cells metastasized to lymph node and bone, PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, and in xenografts of PC-3 cells and hPCP. Western blot analysis gave strong bands from PC tissue extracts compared to BPH tissue. Using RT-PCR, 5-HTR1A mRNA was demonstrated in all PC cell lines. An antagonist of 5-HTR1A (NAN-190) inhibited the growth of PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP cells but not of hPCP cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating an overexpression of 5-HTR subtypes 1A and 1B in PC cells, especially in high-grade tumors. Moreover, 5-HT stimulates proliferation of PC cells and 5-HTR1A antagonists inhibit proliferation. Thus, we propose that 5-HT has an important role in tumor progression, especially in the androgen-independent state of the disease. The design of specific antagonists for this type of receptor might be useful for the growth control of androgen-independent tumors.},

abstract = {Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is a widely used antidepressant agent. Here, we show that sertraline also exhibits antiproliferative activity. Exposure to sertraline leads to a concentration-dependent decrease in protein synthesis. Moreover, polysome profile analysis of sertraline-treated cells shows a reduction in polysome content and a concomitant increase in 80S ribosomes. The inhibition in translation caused by sertraline is associated with decreased levels of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, altered localization of eIF4E, and increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The latter event leads to increased REDD1 expression, which in turn impinges on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by affecting TSC1/2 signaling. Sertraline also independently targets the mTOR signaling pathway downstream of Rheb. In the Emu-myc murine lymphoma model where carcinogenesis is driven by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) inactivation, sertraline is able to enhance chemosensitivity to doxorubicin. Our results indicate that sertraline exerts antiproliferative activity by targeting the mTOR signaling pathway in a REDD1-dependent manner.},

This article describes a process developed by the investigators in the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00047437) to establish authorship of the manuscripts describing the baseline characteristics, study design, and trial outcomes in an equitable and transparent manner based on objective, quantifiable contributions to the study as a whole. The HF-ACTION investigators developed a scoring system that assigned points to investigators by using the criteria established for enrollment, adherence to the exercise program, data completion, committee service, and other trial efforts. The scoring system has been successfully implemented for baseline manuscripts and has allowed many investigators to participate in the HF-ACTION publication process.},

abstract = {The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.},

abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical and microbial strain collections is an indispensable tool for modern chemical and systems biology; however, HTS data sets have inherent systematic and random error, which may lead to false-positive or false-negative results. Several methods of normalization of data exist; nevertheless, due to the limitations of each, no single method has been universally adopted. Here, we present a method of data visualization and normalization that is effective, intuitive, and easy to implement in a spreadsheet program. For each plate, the data are ordered by ascending values and a plot thereof yields a curve that is a signature of the plate data. Curve shape characteristics provide intuitive visualization of the frequency and strength of inhibitors, activators, and noise on the plate, allowing potentially problematic plates to be flagged. To reduce plate-to-plate variation, the data can be normalized by the mean of the middle 50{\%} of ordered values, also called the interquartile mean (IQM) or the 50{\%} trimmed mean of the plate. Positional effects due to bias in columns, rows, or wells can be corrected using the interquartile mean of each well position across all plates (IQMW) as a second level of normalization. We illustrate the utility of this method using data sets from biochemical and phenotypic screens.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most data analysis tools for high-throughput screening (HTS) seek to uncover interesting hits for further analysis. They typically assume a low hit rate per plate. Hit rates can be dramatically higher in secondary screening, RNAi screening and in drug sensitivity testing using biologically active drugs. In particular, drug sensitivity testing on primary cells is often based on dose-response experiments, which pose a more stringent requirement for data quality and for intra- and inter-plate variation. Here, we compared common plate normalization and noise-reduction methods, including the B-score and the Loess a local polynomial fit method under high hit-rate scenarios of drug sensitivity testing. We generated simulated 384-well plate HTS datasets, each with 71 plates having a range of 20 (5{\%}) to 160 (42{\%}) hits per plate, with controls placed either at the edge of the plates or in a scattered configuration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 20{\%} (77/384) as the critical hit-rate after which the normalizations started to perform poorly. Results from real drug testing experiments supported this estimation. In particular, the B-score resulted in incorrect normalization of high hit-rate plates, leading to poor data quality, which could be attributed to its dependency on the median polish algorithm. We conclude that a combination of a scattered layout of controls per plate and normalization using a polynomial least squares fit method, such as Loess helps to reduce column, row and edge effects in HTS experiments with high hit-rates and is optimal for generating accurate dose-response curves.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: john.mpindi@helsinki.fiAvailability and implementation, Supplementary information: R code and Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput screening (HTS) is a key part of the drug discovery process during which thousands of chemical compounds are screened and their activity levels measured in order to identify potential drug candidates (i.e., hits). Many technical, procedural or environmental factors can cause systematic measurement error or inequalities in the conditions in which the measurements are taken. Such systematic error has the potential to critically affect the hit selection process. Several error correction methods and software have been developed to address this issue in the context of experimental HTS 1234567. Despite their power to reduce the impact of systematic error when applied to error perturbed datasets, those methods also have one disadvantage - they introduce a bias when applied to data not containing any systematic error 6. Hence, we need first to assess the presence of systematic error in a given HTS assay and then carry out systematic error correction method if and only if the presence of systematic error has been confirmed by statistical tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We tested three statistical procedures to assess the presence of systematic error in experimental HTS data, including the $\chi$2 goodness-of-fit test, Student's t-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 8 preceded by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method 9. We applied these procedures to raw HTS measurements, first, and to estimated hit distribution surfaces, second. The three competing tests were applied to analyse simulated datasets containing different types of systematic error, and to a real HTS dataset. Their accuracy was compared under various error conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A successful assessment of the presence of systematic error in experimental HTS assays is possible when the appropriate statistical methodology is used. Namely, the t-test should be carried out by researchers to determine whether systematic error is present in their HTS data prior to applying any error correction method. This important step can significantly improve the quality of selected hits.},

@article{Shun2011,
abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) has achieved a dominant role in drug discovery over the past 2 decades. The goal of HTS is to identify active compounds (hits) by screening large numbers of diverse chemical compounds against selected targets and/or cellular phenotypes. The HTS process consists of multiple automated steps involving compound handling, liquid transfers, and assay signal capture, all of which unavoidably contribute to systematic variation in the screening data. The challenge is to distinguish biologically active compounds from assay variability. Traditional plate controls-based and non-controls-based statistical methods have been widely used for HTS data processing and active identification by both the pharmaceutical industry and academic sectors. More recently, improved robust statistical methods have been introduced, reducing the impact of systematic row/column effects in HTS data. To apply such robust methods effectively and properly, we need to understand their necessity and functionality. Data from 6 HTS case histories are presented to illustrate that robust statistical methods may sometimes be misleading and can result in more, rather than less, false positives or false negatives. In practice, no single method is the best hit detection method for every HTS data set. However, to aid the selection of the most appropriate HTS data-processing and active identification methods, the authors developed a 3-step statistical decision methodology. Step 1 is to determine the most appropriate HTS data-processing method and establish criteria for quality control review and active identification from 3-day assay signal window and DMSO validation tests. Step 2 is to perform a multilevel statistical and graphical review of the screening data to exclude data that fall outside the quality control criteria. Step 3 is to apply the established active criterion to the quality-assured data to identify the active compounds.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in biomedical sciences and genetics have increased the pressure on drug development companies to promptly translate new knowledge into treatments for disease. Impelled by the demand and facilitated by technological progress, the number of compounds evaluated during the initial high-throughput screening (HTS) step of drug discovery process has steadily increased. As a highly automated large-scale process, HTS is prone to systematic error caused by various technological and environmental factors. A number of error correction methods have been designed to reduce the effect of systematic error in experimental HTS (Brideau et al., 2003; Carralot et al., 2012; Kevorkov and Makarenkov, 2005; Makarenkov et al., 2007; Malo et al., 2010). Despite their power to correct systematic error when it is present, the applicability of those methods in practice is limited by the fact that they can potentially introduce a bias when applied to unbiased data. We describe two new methods for eliminating systematic error from HTS data based on a prior knowledge of the error location. This information can be obtained using a specific version of the t-test or of the $\chi$(2) goodness-of-fit test as discussed in Dragiev et al. (2011). We will show that both new methods constitute an important improvement over the standard practice of not correcting for systematic error at all as well as over the B-score correction procedure (Brideau et al., 2003) which is widely used in the modern HTS. We will also suggest a more general data preprocessing framework where the new methods can be applied in combination with the Well Correction procedure (Makarenkov et al., 2007). Such a framework will allow for removing systematic biases affecting all plates of a given screen as well as those relative to some of its individual plates.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy affecting nearly 30,000 people annually in the United States. We have previously identified elevated PARP1 levels in SCLC and demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors AZD 2281 and AG014699. Here, we evaluate activity of a novel, potent PARP inhibitor, BMN 673, and identify markers of response as a basis for developing predictive markers for clinical application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Inhibition of SCLC proliferation by BMN 673 was assayed in vitro and effects on tumor growth were measured in SCLC xenograft models. Protein expression and pathway activation was assessed by reverse phase protein array and western blot analysis. PARP inhibition was confirmed using a PAR ELISA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate striking, single agent activity of BMN 673 in SCLC cell lines and xenografts, with single agent BMN 673 exhibiting in vivo activity similar to cisplatin. Sensitivity to BMN 673 was associated with elevated baseline expression levels of several DNA repair proteins, whereas greater drug resistance was observed in SCLC models with baseline activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, we developed and confirmed these data with a novel "DNA repair score" consisting of a group of 17 DNA repair proteins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated expression of multiple DNA repair proteins, as well as a corresponding "DNA repair protein score," predict response to BMN 673 in in vitro SCLC models. These observations complement recent work in which PI3K inhibition sensitizes breast cancer models to PARP inhibition, suggesting cooperation between DNA repair and PI3K pathways.},

@article{Petrone2012,
abstract = {Since the advent of high-throughput screening (HTS), there has been an urgent need for methods that facilitate the interrogation of large-scale chemical biology data to build a mode of action (MoA) hypothesis. This can be done either prior to the HTS by subset design of compounds with known MoA or post HTS by data annotation and mining. To enable this process, we developed a tool that compares compounds solely on the basis of their bioactivity: the chemical biological descriptor “high-throughput screening fingerprint” (HTS-FP). In the current embodiment, data are aggregated from 195 biochemical and cell-based assays developed at Novartis and can be used to identify bioactivity relationships among the in-house collection comprising ∼1.5 million compounds. We demonstrate the value of the HTS-FP for virtual screening and in particular scaffold hopping. HTS-FP outperforms state of the art methods in several aspects, retrieving bioactive compounds with remarkable chemical dissimilarity to a probe structure. We also apply HTS-FP for the design of screening subsets in HTS. Using retrospective data, we show that a biodiverse selection of plates performs significantly better than a chemically diverse selection of plates, both in terms of number of hits and diversity of chemotypes retrieved. This is also true in the case of hit expansion predictions using HTS-FP similarity. Sets of compounds clustered with HTS-FP are biologically meaningful, in the sense that these clusters enrich for genes and gene ontology (GO) terms, showing that compounds that are bioactively similar also tend to target proteins that operate together in the cell. HTS-FP are valuable not only because of their predictive power but mainly because they relate compounds solely on the basis of bioactivity, harnessing the accumulated knowledge of a high-throughput screening facility toward the understanding of how compounds interact with the proteome.},

abstract = {Genes encode instructions that control our physical characteristics, known as traits. Although some traits are controlled by the activity of a single gene, most traits are influenced by the activities of multiple genes.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe genes that influence a particular trait may work independently of each other. However, it is also possible for the genes to interact so that one gene may mask or amplify the effect of another gene. Although gene interactions were first described almost 100 years ago, it has been difficult to identify them and work out the direction of these interactions (i.e., does gene A affect gene B, or vice versa?).$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFischer, Sandmann et al. have now studied the interactions between the genes involved in 21 different traits of fruit fly cells. A technique called RNA interference was used to lower the expression of the genes in different combinations, which made it possible to analyze any changes in the traits that occurred when particular genes were not working properly. Fischer, Sandmann et al. took hundreds of thousands images of the cells and analyzed the changes in cell shape, cell size, cell division and other traits. Next, they developed a method to infer the directions of the interactions between individual pairs of genes from the data and then made a map of the genetic interactions for the traits.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis map was able to reconstruct the known order of activity of genes during cell division and other cell processes. Furthermore, it revealed previously unknown interactions between genes. For example, genes involved in the Ras signaling pathway—which promotes cell growth and is frequently mutated in human tumors—interacted with genes that encode a group of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex. This complex alters how DNA is packaged in cells to control the expression of genes, and these gene interactions may play an important role in the control of cell growth by Ras signaling.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe approach developed by Fischer, Sandmann et al. can shed light on the interactions between genes that produce complex traits of cells. In future, this approach might be helpful to find out which genetic differences between individuals alter the effectiveness of drug treatments, and the impact of using combinations of drugs to treat diseases.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nDOI: [http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05464.002][1]$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.7554/eLife.05464.002},

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how different CNN methods compare with each other and with previ-ous state-of-the-art shallow representations such as the Bag-of-Visual-Words and the Improved Fisher Vector. This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new tech-niques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be success-fully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost.

abstract = {In primary fibroblasts from Leigh Syndrome (LS) patients, isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency is associated with increased reactive oxygen species levels and mitochondrial morpho-functional changes. Empirical evidence suggests these aberrations constitute linked therapeutic targets for small chemical molecules. However, the latter generally induce multiple subtle effects, meaning that in vitro potency analysis or single-parameter high-throughput cell screening are of limited use to identify these molecules. We combine automated image quantification and artificial intelligence to discriminate between primary fibroblasts of a healthy individual and a LS patient based upon their mitochondrial morpho-functional phenotype. We then evaluate the effects of newly developed Trolox variants in LS patient cells. This revealed that Trolox ornithylamide hydrochloride best counterbalanced mitochondrial morpho-functional aberrations, effectively scavenged ROS and increased the maximal activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and citrate synthase. Our results suggest that Trolox-derived antioxidants are promising candidates in therapy development for human mitochondrial disorders.},

abstract = {Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disorder of the $\beta$-globin gene. SCA results in chronic ischemia with pain and tissue injury. The extent of SCA symptoms can be ameliorated by treatment with drugs, which result in increasing the levels of $\gamma$-globin in patient red blood cells. Hydroxyurea (HU) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for SCA, but it has dose-limiting toxicity, and patients exhibit highly variable treatment responses. To identify compounds that may lead to the development of better and safer medicines, we have established a method using primary human bone marrow day 7 erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) to screen for compounds that induce $\gamma$-globin production. First, human marrow CD34(+) cells were cultured and expanded for 7 days and characterized for the expression of erythroid differentiation markers (CD71, CD36, and CD235a). Second, fresh or cryopreserved EPCs were treated with compounds for 3 days in 384-well plates followed by $\gamma$-globin quantification by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was validated using HU and decitabine. From the 7408 compounds screened, we identified at least one new compound with confirmed $\gamma$-globin-inducing activity. Hits are undergoing analysis in secondary assays. In this article, we describe the method of generating fit-for-purpose EPCs; the development, optimization, and validation of the ELISA and secondary assays for $\gamma$-globin detection; and screening results.},

abstract = {The use of patient-specific data in drug and dose selection is becoming an increasingly important component in cancer therapy. Basing drug choice on molecular aspects of the tumor is consistent with the identification of cancer as a molecular disease or dis- eases, even within the same histological type, and its treatment specific to the background fromwhich it arose and exists. Multiple examples exist of single-gene mutations, and over- or under- expression that convey either sensitivity or resistance to a given agent. What about the picture that global gene expression in a cancer presents regarding drug sensitivity or resistance? Coex- pression extrapolation (COXEN) is a methodology that acts as a Rosetta stone between patterns of gene expression that correlate to drug responses in vitro and those in tumors of untreated patients to predict chemosensitivity in such tumors even to drugs that are not specifically indicated for that histotype. Further applications of COXEN in drug discovery allow for in silico screens correlating drug response and gene expression in a genetically diverse cell panel to gene expression patterns in a target tumor with the potential for identifying and repurposing compounds. Here we discuss how COXEN is being developed and tested for application in drug se- lection, repositioning, and repurposing in oncology.},

Conventional methods for phenotyping such 3D cultures use either single or multiple simple parameters based on morphology and fluorescence staining intensity. However, due to their simplicity many details are not taken into account which limits system-level study of phenotype characteristics. Here, we have developed a new image analysis platform to automatically profile 3D cell phenotypes with 598 parameters including morphology, topology, and texture parameters such as wavelet and image moments. As proof of concept, we analyzed mouse breast cancer cells (4T1 cells) in a 384-well plate format following exposure to a diverse set of compounds at different concentrations. The result showed concentration dependent phenotypic trajectories for different biologically active compounds that could be used to classify compounds based on their biological target. To demonstrate the wider applicability of our method, we analyzed the phenotypes of a collection of 44 human breast cancer cell lines cultured in 3D and showed that our method correctly distinguished basal-A, basal-B, luminal and ERBB2+ cell lines in a supervised nearest neighbor classification method.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of small molecules is important for developing probes and novel therapeutic agents in chemical biology and drug discovery. Increasingly, multiplexed small-molecule profiling assays allow simultaneous measurement of many biological response parameters for the same compound (e.g., expression levels for many genes or binding constants against many proteins). Although such methods promise to capture SARs with high granularity, few computational methods are available to support SAR analyses of high-dimensional compound activity profiles. Many of these methods are not generally applicable or reduce the activity space to scalar summary statistics before establishing SARs. In this article, we present a versatile computational method that automatically extracts interpretable SAR rules from high-dimensional profiling data. The rules connect chemical structural features of compounds to patterns in their biological activity profiles. We applied our method to data from novel cell-based gene-expression and imaging assays collected on more than 30,000 small molecules. Based on the rules identified for this data set, we prioritized groups of compounds for further study, including a novel set of putative histone deacetylase inhibitors.},

The question of how to build and evolve efficient screening collections systematically for cell-based and biochemical screening is still unresolved. It is often assumed that chemical structure diversity leads to diverse biological performance of a library. Here, we confirm earlier results showing that this inference is not always valid and suggest instead using biological measurement diversity derived from multiplexed profiling in the construction of libraries with diverse assay performance patterns for cell-based screens. Rather than using results from tens or hundreds of completed assays, which is resource intensive and not easily extensible, we use high-dimensional image-based cell morphology and gene expression profiles. We piloted this approach using over 30,000 compounds. We show that small-molecule profiling can be used to select compound sets with high rates of activity and diverse biological performance.},

abstract = {Discovering small-molecule modulators for thousands of gene products requires multiple stages of biological testing, specificity evaluation, and chemical optimization. Many cellular profiling methods, including cellular sensitivity, gene expression, and cellular imaging, have emerged as methods to assess the functional consequences of biological perturbations. Cellular profiling methods applied to small-molecule science provide opportunities to use complex phenotypic information to prioritize and optimize small-molecule structures simultaneously against multiple biological endpoints. As throughput increases and cost decreases for such technologies, we see an emerging paradigm of using more information earlier in probe-discovery and drug-discovery efforts. Moreover, increasing access to public datasets makes possible the construction of 'virtual' profiles of small-molecule performance, even when multiplexed measurements were not performed or when multidimensional profiling was not the original intent. We review some key conceptual advances in small-molecule phenotypic profiling, emphasizing connections to other information, such as protein-binding measurements, genetic perturbations, and cell states. We argue that to maximally leverage these measurements in probe-discovery and drug-discovery requires a fundamental connection to synthetic chemistry, allowing the consequences of synthetic decisions to be described in terms of changes in small-molecule profiles. Mining such data in the context of chemical structure and synthesis strategies can inform decisions about chemistry procurement and library development, leading to optimal small-molecule screening collections.},

abstract = {Quantitative analytical approaches for discovering new compound mechanisms are required for summarizing high-throughput, image-based drug screening data. Here we present a multivariate method for classifying untreated and treated human cancer cells based on approximately 300 single-cell phenotypic measurements. This classification provides a score, measuring the magnitude of the drug effect, and a vector, indicating the simultaneous phenotypic changes induced by the drug. These two quantities were used to characterize compound activities and identify dose-dependent multiphasic responses. A systematic survey of profiles extracted from a 100-compound compendium of image data revealed that only 10-15{\%} of the original features were required to detect a compound effect. We report the most informative image features for each compound and fluorescence marker set using a method that will be useful for determining minimal collections of readouts for drug screens. Our approach provides human-interpretable profiles and automatic determination of on- and off-target effects.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR chloride channel. Deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del), the most frequent CF mutation, impairs the maturation and gating of the CFTR protein. Such defects may be corrected in vitro by pharmacological modulators named as correctors and potentiators, respectively. We have evaluated a panel of correctors and potentiators derived from various sources to assess potency, efficacy, and mechanism of action. For this purpose, we have used functional and biochemical assays on two different cell expression systems, Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) and A549 cells. The order of potency and efficacy of potentiators was similar in the two cell types considered, with phenylglycine PG-01 and isoxazole UCCF-152 being the most potent and least potent, respectively. Most potentiators were also effective on two mutations, G551D and G1349D, that cause a purely gating defect. In contrast, corrector effect was strongly affected by cell background, with the extreme case of many compounds working in one cell type only. Our findings are in favor of a direct action of potentiators on CFTR, possibly at a common binding site. In contrast, most correctors seem to work indirectly with various mechanisms of action. Combinations of correctors acting at different levels may lead to additive F508del-CFTR rescue.},

The main goal of analysis in this paper is to provide automatic image processing approaches to process neuron images for studying neuron mechanism in high content screening. In the nuclei channel, all nuclei are segmented and detected by applying the gradient vector field based watershed. Then the neuronal nuclei are selected based on the soma region detected in neurite channel. In neurite images, we propose a novel neurite centerline extraction approach using the improved line-pixel detection technique. The proposed neurite tracing method can detect the curvilinear structure more accurately compared with the current existing methods.

abstract = {Cellular populations have been widely observed to respond heterogeneously to perturbation. However, interpreting the observed heterogeneity is an extremely challenging problem because of the complexity of possible cellular phenotypes, the large dimension of potential perturbations, and the lack of methods for separating meaningful biological information from noise. Here, we develop an image-based approach to characterize cellular phenotypes based on patterns of signaling marker colocalization. Heterogeneous cellular populations are characterized as mixtures of phenotypically distinct subpopulations, and responses to perturbations are summarized succinctly as probabilistic redistributions of these mixtures. We apply our method to characterize the heterogeneous responses of cancer cells to a panel of drugs. We find that cells treated with drugs of (dis-)similar mechanism exhibit (dis-)similar patterns of heterogeneity. Despite the observed phenotypic diversity of cells observed within our data, low-complexity models of heterogeneity were sufficient to distinguish most classes of drug mechanism. Our approach offers a computational framework for assessing the complexity of cellular heterogeneity, investigating the degree to which perturbations induce redistributions of a limited, but nontrivial, repertoire of underlying states and revealing functional significance contained within distinct patterns of heterogeneous responses.},

In human neutrophils, polarization is characterized by the translocation of distinct sets of signaling molecules to opposite ends of the cell and the rapid rearrangement of cytoskeleton to initiate migration. While many image-based studies have described cellular morphology and the intensity level of polarity signaling molecules, systematic characterization of the spatial distribution of polarity signaling molecules has been lacking. Here we designed a collection of analytical features to quantify spatial phenotypes of polarity molecules. We compared our features to commonly used polarity readouts and found that they captured additional aspects of the polarization dynamics that were not contained in the existing features.

abstract = {An imaged-based profiling and analysis system was developed to predict clinically effective synergistic drug combinations that could accelerate the identification of effective multi-drug therapies for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and other challenging malignancies. The identification of effective drug combinations for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was achieved by integrating high-content screening, computational analysis, and experimental biology. The approach was based on altered cellular phenotypes induced by 55 FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds, acquired using fluorescence microscopy and retained in multivariate compound profiles. Dissimilarities between compound profiles guided the identification of 5 combinations, which were assessed for qualitative interaction on TNBC cell growth. The combination of the microtubule-targeting drug vinblastine with KSP/Eg5 motor protein inhibitors monastrol or ispinesib showed potent synergism in 3 independent TNBC cell lines, which was not substantiated in normal fibroblasts. The synergistic interaction was mediated by an increase in mitotic arrest with cells demonstrating typical ispinesib-induced monopolar mitotic spindles, which translated into enhanced apoptosis induction. The antitumour activity of the combination vinblastine/ispinesib was confirmed in an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC. Compared to single drug treatment, combination treatment significantly reduced tumour growth without causing increased toxicity. Image-based profiling and analysis led to the rapid discovery of a drug combination effective against TNBC in vitro and in vivo, and has the potential to lead to the development of new therapeutic options in other hard-to-treat cancers. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

In this study we report the temporal sequence of changes in cell shape, F-actin, and cell surface morphology during cellular polarization induced by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) in human neutrophils in suspension.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Neutrophil shape changes induced by 10(-8) M fMLP were observed with DIC microscopy. Size and cellular granularity were analyzed by flow cytometry measuring their forward and side scattered light. To visualize F-actin distribution, neutrophils were labeled with the fluorescence probe FITC-phalloidin, and were examined with fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cell surface morphology was assessed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The stimulation of round-smooth neutrophils with nanomolar concentrations (10(-8) M) of fMLP in suspension induced a temporal sequence of morphological changes during cell polarization, characterized by 1) increase in size as determined by forward angle scattered light, 2) rapid redistribution of F-actin from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization to the cell periphery, and 3) rapid reorganization of cell surface morphological features, with accumulation of plasma membrane in the front of polar cells. Four cell shapes were identified with SEM after stimulation of round-smooth neutrophils: round-ridged, round-ruffled, nonpolar ruffled, and polar cells. These cell shapes were correlated with a cortical localization, focal aggregates, and multipolar distribution of F-actin. In polar neutrophils, F-actin became concentrated in the front of the cell.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings show the relation between reorganization of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and modifications in cell shape and surface features during cell polarization induced after fMLP activation in neutrophils. This approach offers a powerful tool for further analysis of receptor distribution in polarized, motile neutrophils.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool for drug discovery. However, the discovery of drugs targeting neurons is still hampered by the inability to accurately identify and quantify the phenotypic changes of multiple neurons in a single image (named multi-neuron image) of a high-content screen. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an automated image analysis method for analyzing multi-neuron images.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose an automated analysis method with novel descriptors of neuromorphology features for analyzing HCS-based multi-neuron images, called HCS-neurons. To observe multiple phenotypic changes of neurons, we propose two kinds of descriptors which are neuron feature descriptor (NFD) of 13 neuromorphology features, e.g., neurite length, and generic feature descriptors (GFDs), e.g., Haralick texture. HCS-neurons can 1) automatically extract all quantitative phenotype features in both NFD and GFDs, 2) identify statistically significant phenotypic changes upon drug treatments using ANOVA and regression analysis, and 3) generate an accurate classifier to group neurons treated by different drug concentrations using support vector machine and an intelligent feature selection method. To evaluate HCS-neurons, we treated P19 neurons with nocodazole (a microtubule depolymerizing drug which has been shown to impair neurite development) at six concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 ng/mL. The experimental results show that all the 13 features of NFD have statistically significant difference with respect to changes in various levels of nocodazole drug concentrations (NDC) and the phenotypic changes of neurites were consistent to the known effect of nocodazole in promoting neurite retraction. Three identified features, total neurite length, average neurite length, and average neurite area were able to achieve an independent test accuracy of 90.28{\%} for the six-dosage classification problem. This NFD module and neuron image datasets are provided as a freely downloadable MatLab project at http://iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/HCS-Neurons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Few automatic methods focus on analyzing multi-neuron images collected from HCS used in drug discovery. We provided an automatic HCS-based method for generating accurate classifiers to classify neurons based on their phenotypic changes upon drug treatments. The proposed HCS-neurons method is helpful in identifying and classifying chemical or biological molecules that alter the morphology of a group of neurons in HCS.},

In HCS, changes in cellular morphology and biomarker distributions provide an information-rich profile of cellular responses to experimental treatments such as small molecules or gene knockdown probes. One obstacle that currently exists with such cell-based assays is the availability of image processing algorithms that are capable of reliably and automatically analyzing large HCS image sets. HCS images of primary neuronal cell cultures are particularly challenging to analyze due to complex cellular morphology. Here we present a robust method for quantifying and statistically analyzing the morphology of neuronal cells in HCS images. The major advantages of our method over existing software lie in its capability to correct non-uniform illumination using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization method; segment neuromeres using Gabor-wavelet texture analysis; and detect faint neurites by a novel phase-based neurite extraction algorithm that is invariant to changes in illumination and contrast and can accurately localize neurites. Our method was successfully applied to analyze a large HCS image set generated in a morphology screen for polyglutamine-mediated neuronal toxicity using primary neuronal cell cultures derived from embryos of a Drosophila Huntington's Disease (HD) model.},

Different from the conventional screening system, herein phenotypic screening in combination with multi-omics-based target identification and validation (MOTIV) is introduced. First, phenotypic screening provides visual effect of bioactive small molecules in the cell or organism level. It is important to know the effect on the cell or organism level since small molecules affect not only a single target but the entire cellular mechanism within a cell or organism. Secondly, MOTIV provides systemic approach to discover the target protein of bioactive small molecule. With the chemical genomics and proteomics approach of target identification methods, various target protein candidates are identified. Then network analysis and validations of these candidates result in identifying the biologically relevant target protein and cellular mechanism. Overall, the combination of phenotypic screening and MOTIV will provide an effective approach to discover new bioactive small molecules and their target protein and mechanism identification. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently, a phenotypic approach-screens that assess the effects of compounds on cells, tissues, or whole organisms-has been reconsidered and reintroduced as a complementary strategy of a target-based approach for drug discovery. Although the finding of novel bioactive compounds from large chemical libraries has become routine, the identification of their molecular targets is still a time-consuming and difficult process, making this step rate-limiting in drug development. In the last decade, we and other researchers have amassed a large amount of phenotypic data through progress in omics research and advances in instrumentation. Accordingly, the profiling methodologies using these datasets expertly have emerged to identify and validate specific molecular targets of drug candidates, attaining some progress in current drug discovery (e.g., eribulin). In the case of a compound that shows an unprecedented phenotype likely by inhibiting a first-in-class target, however, such phenotypic profiling is invalid. Under the circumstances, a photo-crosslinking affinity approach should be beneficial. In this review, we describe and summarize recent progress in both affinity-based (direct) and phenotypic profiling (indirect) approaches for chemical biology target identification.},

abstract = {The field of bioimage informatics concerns the development and use of methods for computational analysis of biological images. Traditionally, analysis of such images has been done manually. Manual annotation is, however, slow, expensive, and often highly variable from one expert to another. Furthermore, with modern automated microscopes, hundreds to thousands of images can be collected per hour, making manual analysis infeasible. This field borrows from the pattern recognition and computer vision literature (which contain many techniques for image processing and recognition), but has its own unique challenges and tradeoffs. Fluorescence microscopy images represent perhaps the largest class of biological images for which automation is needed. For this modality, typical problems include cell segmentation, classification of phenotypical response, or decisions regarding differentiated responses (treatment vs. control setting). This overview focuses on the problem of subcellular location determination as a running example, but the techniques discussed are often applicable to other problems.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach for elucidating the nonlinear degrees of freedom in a distribution of shapes depicted in digital images. By combining a deformation-based method for measuring distances between two shape conﬁgurations together with multidimensional scaling, a method for determining the number of degrees of freedom in a shape distribution is described. In addition, a method for visu- alizing the most representative modes of variation (underlying shape parameterization) in a nuclei shape distribution is also presented. The novel approach takes into account the nonlinear nature of shape manifolds and is related to the ISOMAP algorithm. We apply the method to the task of analyzing the shape distribution of HeLa cell nuclei and conclude that approximately three parameters are respon- sible for their shape variation. Excluding differences in size, transla- tion, and orientation, these are: elongation, bending (concavity), and shifts in mass distribution. In addition, results show that, contrary to common intuition, the most likely nuclear shape conﬁguration is not symmetric.},

abstract = {The empirical characterization of nuclear shape distributions is an important unsolved problem with many applications in biology and medicine. Numerous genetic diseases and cancers have alterations in nuclear morphology, and methods for characterization of morphology could aid in both diagnoses and fundamental understanding of these disorders. Automated approaches have been used to measure features related to the size and shape of the cell nucleus, and statistical analysis of these features has often been performed assuming an underlying Euclidean (linear) vector space. We discuss the difficulties associated with the analysis of nuclear shape in light of the fact that shape spaces are nonlinear, and demonstrate methods for characterizing nuclear shapes and shape distributions based on spatial transformations that map one nucleus to another. By combining large deformation metric mapping with multidimensional scaling we offer a flexible approach for elucidating the intrinsic nonlinear degrees of freedom of a distribution of nuclear shapes. More specifically, we demonstrate approaches for nuclear shape interpolation and computation of mean nuclear shape. We also provide a method for estimating the number of free parameters that contribute to shape as well as an approach for visualizing most representative shape variations within a distribution of nuclei. The proposed methodology can be completely automated, is independent of the dimensionality of the images, and can handle complex shapes. Results obtained by analyzing two sets of images of HeLa cells are shown. In addition to identifying the modes of variation in normal HeLa nuclei, the effects of lamin A/C on nuclear morphology are quantitatively described.},

abstract = {An image acquisition and processing system has been developed for quantitative microscopy of absorption or fluorescence in stained cells. Three different light transducers are used in the system to exploit the best characteristics of these sensors for different biological measurements. A digital scanner, in the form of a linear array charge- coupled device (CCD), acquires data with high spatial and photometric resolution. A color (RGB) camera is employed when spectral information is required for the segmentation of cellular subcomponents. An image- intensified charged-injection device (CID) camera provides for very low light intensity measurements, primarily for fluorescence-labeled cells. Properties of these transducers, such as contrast transfer function, linearity, and photo-response nonuniformity, have been measured. Two dedicated image processing units were incorporated into the system. The front-end processor, based on a digital signal processor, provides functions such as object detection, raw image calibration, compression, artifact removal, and filtering. The second image processor is associated with the frame memory and includes a histogram processor, a dedicated arithmetic logic unit for image processing functions, and a graphics module for one-bit overlay functions. An interactive program was developed to acquire cell images and to experiment with a range of segmentation algorithms, feature extractions, and other image processing functions. The results of any image operation are displayed on the video monitor. Once a desired processing sequence is determined, the sequence may be stored to become part of a command library and can be executed thereafter as a single instruction.},

abstract = {Methods for numerical description and subsequent classification of cellular protein localization patterns are described. Images representing the localization patterns of 4 proteins and DNA were obtained using fluorescence microscopy and divided into distinct training and test sets. The images were processed to remove out-of-focus and background fluorescence and 2 sets of numeric features were generated: Zernike moments and Haralick texture features. These feature sets were used as inputs to either a classification tree or a neural network. Classifier performance (the average percent of each type of image correctly classified) on previously unseen images ranged from 63{\%} for a classification tree using Zernike moments to 88{\%} for a backpropagation neural network using a combination of features from the 2 feature sets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying pattern recognition methods to subcellular localization patterns, enabling sets of previously unseen images from a single class to be classified with an expected accuracy greater than 99{\%}. This will provide not only a new automated way to describe proteins, based on localization rather than sequence, but also has potential application in the automation of microscope functions and in the field of gene discovery.},

abstract = {Functional super-resolution (fSR) microscopy is based on the automated toponome imaging system (TIS). fSR-TIS provides insight into the myriad of different cellular functionalities by direct imaging of large subcellular protein networks in morphologically intact cells and tissues, referred to as the toponome. By cyclical fluorescence imaging of at least 100 molecular cell components, fSR-TIS overcomes the spectral limitations of fluorescence microscopy, which is the essential condition for the detection of protein network structures in situ/in vivo. The resulting data sets precisely discriminate between cell types, subcellular structures, cell states and diseases (fSR). With up to 16bits per protein, the power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) is at least 2 100 per subcellular data point. It provides the dimensionality necessary to uncover thousands of distinct protein clusters including their subcellular hierarchies controlling protein network topology and function in the one cell or tissue section. Here we review the technology and findings showing that functional protein networks of the cell surface in different cancers encompass the same hierarchical and spatial coding principle, but express cancer-specific toponome codes within that scheme (referred to as TIS codes). Findings suggest that TIS codes, extracted from large-scale toponome data, have the potential to be next-generation biomarkers because of their cell type and disease specificity. This is functionally substantiated by the observation that blocking toponome-specific lead proteins results in disassembly of molecular networks and loss of function. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This method, termed SWITCH, uniformly secures tissue architecture, native biomolecules, and antigenicity across an entire system by synchronizing the tissue preservation reaction. The heat- and chemical-resistant nature of the resulting framework permits multiple rounds ({\textgreater}20) of relabeling. We have performed 22 rounds of labeling of a single tissue with precise co-registration of multiple datasets. Furthermore, SWITCH synchronizes labeling reactions to improve probe penetration depth and uniformity of staining. With SWITCH, we performed combinatorial protein expression profiling of the human cortex and also interrogated the geometric structure of the fiber pathways in mouse brains.

abstract = {Rounded-amoeboid cancer cells use actomyosin contractility driven by Rho-ROCK and JAK-STAT3 to migrate efficiently. It has been suggested that rounded-amoeboid cancer cells do not require matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to invade. Here we compare MMP levels in rounded-amoeboid and elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cells. Surprisingly, we find that rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells secrete higher levels of several MMPs, including collagenase MMP-13 and gelatinase MMP-9. As a result, rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells degrade collagen I more efficiently than elongated-mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, using a non-catalytic mechanism, MMP-9 promotes rounded-amoeboid 3D migration through regulation of actomyosin contractility via CD44 receptor. MMP-9 is upregulated in a panel of rounded-amoeboid compared with elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cell lines and its levels are controlled by ROCK-JAK-STAT3 signalling. MMP-9 expression increases during melanoma progression and it is particularly prominent in the invasive fronts of lesions, correlating with cell roundness. Therefore, rounded-amoeboid cells use both catalytic and non-catalytic activities of MMPs for invasion.},

abstract = {Quantitative imaging has become a vital technique in biological discovery and clinical diagnostics; a plethora of tools have recently been developed to enable new and accelerated forms of biological investigation. Increasingly, the capacity for high-throughput experimentation provided by new imaging modalities, contrast techniques, microscopy tools, microfluidics and computer controlled systems shifts the experimental bottleneck from the level of physical manipulation and raw data collection to automated recognition and data processing. Yet, despite their broad importance, image analysis solutions to address these needs have been narrowly tailored. Here, we present a generalizable formulation for autonomous identification of specific biological structures that is applicable for many problems. The process flow architecture we present here utilizes standard image processing techniques and the multi-tiered application of classification models such as support vector machines (SVM). These low-level functions are readily available in a large array of image processing software packages and programming languages. Our framework is thus both easy to implement at the modular level and provides specific high-level architecture to guide the solution of more complicated image-processing problems. We demonstrate the utility of the classification routine by developing two specific classifiers as a toolset for automation and cell identification in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. To serve a common need for automated high-resolution imaging and behavior applications in the C. elegans research community, we contribute a ready-to-use classifier for the identification of the head of the animal under bright field imaging. Furthermore, we extend our framework to address the pervasive problem of cell-specific identification under fluorescent imaging, which is critical for biological investigation in multicellular organisms or tissues. Using these examples as a guide, we envision the broad utility of the framework for diverse problems across different length scales and imaging methods.},

@article{Yamori2003,
abstract = {Studies conducted at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) and in our laboratory show that databases including the drug sensitivities of panels of many human cancer cell lines provide valuable information on the molecular pharmacology of anticancer drugs. We established a panel of 39 cell lines of various human cancers and developed a database of their chemosensitivities. Drugs were profiled in terms of their "fingerprints", patterns of differential activity against the cell lines. There was a significant correlation between a drug's fingerprint and its mode of action, as observed in the NCI panel of 60 cell lines. Therefore our cell-line panel is a powerful tool to predict the modes of action of new compounds. We have been using this system for drug discovery, coupled with various target-based drug screenings. We used the system to identify a novel DNA minor-groove binder, MS-247, which has inhibitory activity against topoisomerases I and II, and potent in vivo antitumor activity against various human cancer xenografts. We also discovered a potent novel telomerase inhibitor, FJ5002, by mining our database with the COMPARE algorithm, followed by experimental validation. We investigated the gene expression profiles of the cell lines by using DNA microarrays to find profiles determining cellular chemosensitivity and new targets for anticancer drugs. Our integrated database, including the chemosensitivities and gene expression profiles of the cell-line panel, could provide a basis for drug discovery and personalized therapy.},

abstract = {Small molecules that perturb specific protein functions are valuable tools for dissecting complex processes in mammalian cells. A combination of two phenotype-based screens, one based on a specific posttranslational modification, the other visualizing microtubules and chromatin, was used to identify compounds that affect mitosis. One compound, here named monastrol, arrested mammalian cells in mitosis with monopolar spindles. In vitro, monastrol specifically inhibited the motility of the mitotic kinesin Eg5, a motor protein required for spindle bipolarity. All previously known small molecules that specifically affect the mitotic machinery target tubulin. Monastrol will therefore be a particularly useful tool for studying mitotic mechanisms.},

abstract = {This article reports label-free, real-time, and single-cell quantification of the invasion of spheroidal colon cancer cells through three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel using a resonant waveguide grating (RWG) imager. This imager employs a time-resolved swept wavelength interrogation scheme to monitor cell invasion and adhesion with a temporal resolution up to 3 s and a spatial resolution of 12 $\mu$m. As the model system, spheroids of human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells are generated by culturing the cells in 96-well round-bottom ultralow attachment plates. 3D Matrigel is formed by its gelation in 384-well RWG biosensor microplates. The invasion and adhesion of spheroidal HT29 cells is initiated by placing individual spheroids onto the Matrigel-coated biosensors. The time series RWG images are obtained and used to extract the optical signatures arising from the adhesion after the cells are dissociated from the spheroids and invade through the 3D Matrigel. Compound profiling shows that epidermal growth factor accelerates cancer cell invasion, while vandetanib, a multitarget kinase inhibitor, dose-dependently inhibits invasion. This study demonstrates that the label-free imager can monitor in real-time the invasion of spheroidal cancer cells through 3D matrices.},

abstract = {Multicellular aggregates of cells, termed spheroids, are of interest for studying tumor behavior and for evaluating the response of pharmacologically active agents. Spheroids more faithfully reproduce the tumor macrostructure found in vivo compared to classical 2D monolayers. We present a method for embedding spheroids within collagen gels followed by quantitative and qualitative whole spheroid and single cell analyses enabling characterization over the length scales from molecular to macroscopic. Spheroid producing and embedding capabilities are demonstrated for U2OS and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, of osteosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma origin, respectively. Finally, using the MDA-MB-231 tumor model, the chemotherapeutic response between paclitaxel delivery as a bolus dose, as practiced in the clinic, is compared to delivery within an expansile nanoparticle. The expansile nanoparticle delivery route provides a superior outcome and the results mirror those observed in a murine xenograft model. These findings highlight the synergistic beneficial results that may arise from the use of a drug delivery system, and the need to evaluate both drug candidates and delivery systems in the research and preclinical screening phases of a new cancer therapy development program.},

These lesions have been shown to constitute both risk indicators and nonobligate precursors of invasive breast cancer, they are relatively uncommon, and are most often identified in specimens taken for other reasons. Their incidence has increased in the last 2 decades, and novel variants, including a pleomorphic type, have been described. Loss of E-cadherin expression is recognized as a hallmark diagnostic feature of LN and invasive lobular carcinomas, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using anti-E-cadherin antibodies has been proven to be a useful method to differentiate between lobular and ductal lesions. The frequent use of E-cadherin IHC analysis in routine diagnostic histopathology, however, has resulted in confusion with regard to the actual value of IHC with antibodies against E-cadherin and other proteins of the cadherin-catenin complex. This review provides an update on recent clinicopathologic and molecular data on LN and invasive lobular carcinoma and a discussion about the use and limitations of IHC with E-cadherin in diagnostic breast pathology.},

@article{Johnson1993,
abstract = {The aspartyl protease cathepsin D has been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis when found at high levels in primary breast tumors. It has been suggested that this is because the production of cathepsin D increases the invasive potential of the tumor cells, thus increasing the probability of metastasis. We have therefore conducted experiments to determine if secreted cathepsin D makes a significant contribution to the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells in the Boyden chamber assay of invasion, which measures the ability of a cell to invade through an artificial basement membrane. Cathepsin D secretion and Boyden chamber invasiveness were measured in nine clones of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and no correlation was found between cathepsin secretion and invasive behavior. Invasion assays were also conducted in the presence of the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A, and no inhibition of the invasive behavior of cells was seen. Since low-pH environments are required for both the activation of pro-cathepsin D and the activity of the mature enzyme, assays were also conducted in the presence of chloroquine to neutralize the pH in the acidic compartments of the cells. This treatment did not inhibit invasiveness. Cathepsin D secretion by the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-468, SK-Br-3, and MCF-7-ADRr was also measured. Again, there was no correlation with invasion. In fact, cathepsin D levels were inversely correlated with aggressive behavior in vivo and in vitro in previously reported studies. These data suggest that cathepsin D secretion by tumor cells is not an important determinant of the invasiveness of the tumor cells per se. These data also reinforce the view that the poor prognosis in clinical breast cancer linked to high tumor levels of cathepsin D is probably due to high levels of cathepsin D in the stromal components of the tumor such as infiltrating inflammatory cells.},

abstract = {We recently demonstrated that tissue kallikrein (TK) promotes keratinocyte migration through activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR(1)) and transactivation of the epi-dermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, we investigated the potential role of PAR(1) in mediating the effect of TK on cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Our results show that TK promotes DU145 prostate cancer cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner, but has no effect on A549 lung cancer cells. Active TK markedly increases DU145 cell migration and invasion, which are blocked by aprotinin but minimally affected by icatibant; kinin treatment has little effect. TK-induced cell migration and invasion are abolished by inhibition of PAR(1) using a pharmacological inhibitor or RNA interference. The effect of TK on cell migration and invasion are also blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C, c-Src, matrix metalloproteinase, EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, TK stimulates ERK phosphorylation, which is inhibited by an EGFR antagonist. Additionally, TK but not kinin stimulates DU145 cell proliferation through activation of the kinin B2 receptor, but not PAR(1) and EGFR. These results indicate differential signaling pathways mediated by TK in promoting prostate cancer cell migration and invasion via PAR(1) activation, and proliferation via kinin B2 receptor stimulation.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that the lysosomal proteinases cathepsin B, L and D participate in tumour invasion and metastasis. Whereas for cathepsins B and L the role of active enzyme in invasion processes has been confirmed, cathepsin D was suggested to support tumour progression via its pro-peptide, rather than by its proteolytic activity. In this study we have compared the presence of active cathepsins B, L and D in ras-transformed human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A neoT) with their ability to invade matrigel. In this cell line high expression of all three cathepsins was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. The effect of proteolytic activity on cell invasion was studied by adding various natural and synthetic cysteine and aspartic proteinase inhibitors. The most effective compound was chicken cystatin, a general natural inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, (82.8+/-1.6{\%} inhibition of cell invasion), followed by the synthetic inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane (E-64). CLIK-148, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin L, showed a lower effect than chicken cystatin and E-64. Pepstatin A weakly inhibited invasion, whereas the same molar concentrations of squash aspartic proteinase (SQAPI)-like inhibitor, isolated from squash Cucurbita pepo, showed significant inhibition (65.7+/-1.8{\%}). We conclude that both cysteine and aspartic proteinase activities are needed for invasion by MCF-10A neoT cells in vitro.},

abstract = {Human cancers exhibit strong phenotypic differences that can be visualized noninvasively by medical imaging. Radiomics refers to the comprehensive quantification of tumour phenotypes by applying a large number of quantitative image features. Here we present a radiomic analysis of 440 features quantifying tumour image intensity, shape and texture, which are extracted from computed tomography data of 1,019 patients with lung or head-and-neck cancer. We find that a large number of radiomic features have prognostic power in independent data sets of lung and head-and-neck cancer patients, many of which were not identified as significant before. Radiogenomics analysis reveals that a prognostic radiomic signature, capturing intratumour heterogeneity, is associated with underlying gene-expression patterns. These data suggest that radiomics identifies a general prognostic phenotype existing in both lung and head-and-neck cancer. This may have a clinical impact as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision-support in cancer treatment at low cost.},

Although arguably the most common application of fluorescence microscopy in biomedical research, studies evaluating the "colocalization" of two probes are seldom quantified, despite a diversity of image analysis tools that have been specifically developed for that purpose.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is overwhelming evidence that in vitro three-dimensional tumor cell cultures more accurately reflect the complex in vivo microenvironment than simple two-dimensional cell monolayers, not least with respect to gene expression profiles, signaling pathway activity and drug sensitivity. However, most currently available three-dimensional techniques are time consuming and/or lack reproducibility; thus standardized and rapid protocols are urgently needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address this requirement, we have developed a versatile toolkit of reproducible three-dimensional tumor spheroid models for dynamic, automated, quantitative imaging and analysis that are compatible with routine high-throughput preclinical studies. Not only do these microplate methods measure three-dimensional tumor growth, but they have also been significantly enhanced to facilitate a range of functional assays exemplifying additional key hallmarks of cancer, namely cell motility and matrix invasion. Moreover, mutual tissue invasion and angiogenesis is accommodated by coculturing tumor spheroids with murine embryoid bodies within which angiogenic differentiation occurs. Highly malignant human tumor cells were selected to exemplify therapeutic effects of three specific molecularly-targeted agents: PI-103 (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor) and CCT130234 (in-house phospholipase C (PLC)$\gamma$ inhibitor). Fully automated analysis using a Celigo cytometer was validated for tumor spheroid growth and invasion against standard image analysis techniques, with excellent reproducibility and significantly increased throughput. In addition, we discovered key differential sensitivities to targeted agents between two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, and also demonstrated enhanced potency of some agents against cell migration/invasion compared with proliferation, suggesting their preferential utility in metastatic disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have established and validated a suite of highly reproducible tumor microplate three-dimensional functional assays to enhance the biological relevance of early preclinical cancer studies. We believe these assays will increase the translational predictive value of in vitro drug evaluation studies and reduce the need for in vivo studies by more effective triaging of compounds.},

abstract = {Androgens are C-19 steroids that provide major regulatory influences on male reproductive function. Testosterone, the principal androgenic steroid, is secreted by the Leydig cells of the testes. Both testosterone and its 5 alpha reduced derivative 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are physiological ligands for the androgen receptor (AR). Ligand-activated AR acts as a nuclear transcription factor and mediates androgen action. AR, along with receptors for a number of C-21 steroids such as glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progesterone, share the same 15 base pair consensus element composed of 5'-GGA/TACAnnnTGTTCT-3'. Despite this cross-reactivity at the level of the DNA, physiologically, androgens regulate their target genes with a high degree of receptor specificity. Such a regulatory specificity appears to be due to multiphasic interactions involving enzymatic activation/inactivation of the steroid ligand, interaction with specific receptor-associated nuclear factors on or around the hormone response element, and differential regulation of the receptor gene expression. Conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in target cells is a widespread activation mechanism that amplifies the androgenic signal. Unlike the testosterone-AR complex, DHT-activated AR has a longer half-life, and thus prolongs androgen action. Oxido-reduction of androgens by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and sulfurylation by androgen sulfotransferase are two major pathways of androgen inactivation in target cells. Prenatal deprivation of androgen action, due to mutations in either the AR or the 5 alpha-reductase gene, results in developmental abnormalities of male reproductive tissues and also cause partial or complete androgen-insensitivity syndromes. Elucidation of various molecular steps in androgen action is allowing development of improved therapeutic agents for the management of disorders of androgen action such as the prostatic hypertrophy and neoplasia.},

abstract = {Actin-based stress fiber formation is coupled to microtubule depolymerization through the local activation of RhoA. While the RhoGEF Lfc has been implicated in this cytoskeleton coupling process, it has remained elusive how Lfc is recruited to microtubules and how microtubule recruitment moderates Lfc activity. Here, we demonstrate that the dynein light chain protein Tctex-1 is required for localization of Lfc to microtubules. Lfc residues 139-161 interact with Tctex-1 at a site distinct from the cleft that binds dynein intermediate chain. An NMR-based GEF assay revealed that interaction with Tctex-1 represses Lfc nucleotide exchange activity in an indirect manner that requires both polymerized microtubules and phosphorylation of S885 by PKA. We show that inhibition of Lfc by Tctex-1 is dynein dependent. These studies demonstrate a pivotal role of Tctex-1 as a negative regulator of actin filament organization through its control of Lfc in the crosstalk between microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {One goal of cell biology is to understand how cells adopt different shapes in response to varying environmental and cellular conditions. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cell shape and environment requires a systems-level understanding of the signalling networks that respond to external cues and regulate the cytoskeleton. Classical biochemical and genetic approaches have identified thousands of individual components that contribute to cell shape, but it remains difficult to predict how cell shape is generated by the activity of these components using bottom-up approaches because of the complex nature of their interactions in space and time. Here, we describe the regulation of cellular shape by signalling systems using a top-down approach. We first exploit the shape diversity generated by systematic RNAi screening and comprehensively define the shape space a migratory cell explores. We suggest a simple Boolean model involving the activation of Rac and Rho GTPases in two compartments to explain the basis for all cell shapes in the dataset. Critically, we also generate a probabilistic graphical model to show how cells explore this space in a deterministic, rather than a stochastic, fashion. We validate the predictions made by our model using live-cell imaging. Our work explains how cross-talk between Rho and Rac can generate different cell shapes, and thus morphological heterogeneity, in genetically identical populations.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen rapid growth in the use of diverse compound libraries in classical phenotypic screens to identify modulators of a given process. The subsequent process of identifying the molecular targets of active hits, also called 'target deconvolution', is an essential step for understanding compound mechanism of action and for using the identified hits as tools for further dissection of a given biological process. Recent advances in 'omics' technologies, coupled with in silico approaches and the reduced cost of whole genome sequencing, have greatly improved the workflow of target deconvolution and have contributed to a renaissance of 'modern' phenotypic profiling. In this review, we will outline how both new and old techniques are being used in the difficult process of target identification and validation as well as discuss some of the ongoing challenges remaining for phenotypic screening. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {High-content screening is a powerful method to discover new drugs and carry out basic biological research. Increasingly, high-content screens have come to rely on supervised machine learning (SML) to perform automatic phenotypic classification as an essential step of the analysis. However, this comes at a cost, namely, the labeled examples required to train the predictive model. Classification performance increases with the number of labeled examples, and because labeling examples demands time from an expert, the training process represents a significant time investment. Active learning strategies attempt to overcome this bottleneck by presenting the most relevant examples to the annotator, thereby achieving high accuracy while minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data. In this article, we investigate the impact of active learning on single-cell-based phenotype recognition, using data from three large-scale RNA interference high-content screens representing diverse phenotypic profiling problems. We consider several combinations of active learning strategies and popular SML methods. Our results show that active learning significantly reduces the time cost and can be used to reveal the same phenotypic targets identified using SML. We also identify combinations of active learning strategies and SML methods which perform better than others on the phenotypic profiling problems we studied.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of high-throughput automated image acquisition technologies has forever changed how cell biologists collect and analyze data. Historically, the interpretation of cellular phenotypes in different experimental conditions has been dependent upon the expert opinions of well-trained biologists. Such qualitative analysis is particularly effective in detecting subtle, but important, deviations in phenotypes. However, while the rapid and continuing development of automated microscope-based technologies now facilitates the acquisition of trillions of cells in thousands of diverse experimental conditions, such as in the context of RNA interference (RNAi) or small-molecule screens, the massive size of these datasets precludes human analysis. Thus, the development of automated methods which aim to identify novel and biological relevant phenotypes online is one of the major challenges in high-throughput image-based screening. Ideally, phenotype discovery methods should be designed to utilize prior/existing information and tackle three challenging tasks, i.e. restoring pre-defined biological meaningful phenotypes, differentiating novel phenotypes from known ones and clarifying novel phenotypes from each other. Arbitrarily extracted information causes biased analysis, while combining the complete existing datasets with each new image is intractable in high-throughput screens. RESULTS: Here we present the design and implementation of a novel and robust online phenotype discovery method with broad applicability that can be used in diverse experimental contexts, especially high-throughput RNAi screens. This method features phenotype modelling and iterative cluster merging using improved gap statistics. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed to estimate the distribution of each existing phenotype, and then used as reference distribution in gap statistics. This method is broadly applicable to a number of different types of image-based datasets derived from a wide spectrum of experimental conditions and is suitable to adaptively process new images which are continuously added to existing datasets. Validations were carried out on different dataset, including published RNAi screening using Drosophila embryos [Additional files 1, 2], dataset for cell cycle phase identification using HeLa cells [Additional files 1, 3, 4] and synthetic dataset using polygons, our methods tackled three aforementioned tasks effectively with an accuracy range of 85{\%}-90{\%}. When our method is implemented in the context of a Drosophila genome-scale RNAi image-based screening of cultured cells aimed to identifying the contribution of individual genes towards the regulation of cell-shape, it efficiently discovers meaningful new phenotypes and provides novel biological insight. We also propose a two-step procedure to modify the novelty detection method based on one-class SVM, so that it can be used to online phenotype discovery. In different conditions, we compared the SVM based method with our method using various datasets and our methods consistently outperformed SVM based method in at least two of three tasks by 2{\%} to 5{\%}. These results demonstrate that our methods can be used to better identify novel phenotypes in image-based datasets from a wide range of conditions and organisms. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that our method can detect various novel phenotypes effectively in complex datasets. Experiment results also validate that our method performs consistently under different order of image input, variation of starting conditions including the number and composition of existing phenotypes, and dataset from different screens. In our findings, the proposed method is suitable for online phenotype discovery in diverse high-throughput image-based genetic and chemical screens.},

abstract = {The way in which cells adopt different morphologies is not fully understood. Cell shape could be a continuous variable or restricted to a set of discrete forms. We developed quantitative methods to describe cell shape and show that Drosophila haemocytes in culture are a heterogeneous mixture of five discrete morphologies. In an RNAi screen of genes affecting the morphological complexity of heterogeneous cell populations, we found that most genes regulate the transition between discrete shapes rather than generating new morphologies. In particular, we identified a subset of genes, including the tumour suppressor PTEN, that decrease the heterogeneity of the population, leading to populations enriched in rounded or elongated forms. We show that these genes have a highly conserved function as regulators of cell shape in both mouse and human metastatic melanoma cells.},

abstract = {We have implemented an unbiased cell morphology-based screen to identify small-molecule modulators of cellular processes using the Cytometrix (TM) automated imaging and analysis system. This assay format provides unbiased analysis of morphological effects induced by small molecules by capturing phenotypic readouts of most known classes of pharmacological agents and has the potential to read out pathways for which little is known. Four human-cancer cell lines and one noncancerous primary cell type were treated with 107 small molecules comprising four different protein kinase-inhibitor scaffolds. Cellular phenotypes induced by each compound were quantified by multivariate statistical analysis of the morphology, staining intensity, and spatial attributes of the cellular nuclei, microtubules, and Golgi compartments. Principal component analysis was used to identify inhibitors of cellular components not targeted by known protein kinase inhibitors. Here we focus on a hydroxyl-substituted analog (hydroxy-PP) of the known Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 because it induced cell-specific morphological features distinct from all known kinase inhibitors in the collection. We used affinity purification to identify a target of hydroxy-PP, carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a short-chain dehydrogenase-reductase. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of the CBR1/hydroxy-PP complex to 1.24 A resolution. Structure-based design of more potent and selective CBR1 inhibitors provided probes for analyzing the biological function of CBR1 in A549 cells. These studies revealed a previously unknown function for CBR1 in serum-withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Further studies indicate CBR1 inhibitors may enhance the effectiveness of anticancer anthracyclines. Morphology-based screening of diverse cancer cell types has provided a method for discovering potent new small-molecule probes for cell biological studies and anticancer drug candidates.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Evaluation of previous systems for automated determination of subcellular location from microscope images has been done using datasets in which each location class consisted of multiple images of the same representative protein. Here, we frame a more challenging and useful problem where previously unseen proteins are to be classified. RESULTS: Using CD-tagging, we generated two new image datasets for evaluation of this problem, which contain several different proteins for each location class. Evaluation of previous methods on these new datasets showed that it is much harder to train a classifier that generalizes across different proteins than one that simply recognizes a protein it was trained on. We therefore developed and evaluated additional approaches, incorporating novel modifications of local features techniques. These extended the notion of local features to exploit both the protein image and any reference markers that were imaged in parallel. With these, we obtained a large accuracy improvement in our new datasets over existing methods. Additionally, these features help achieve classification improvements for other previously studied datasets. AVAILABILITY: The datasets are available for download at http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/data/. The software was written in Python and C++ and is available under an open-source license at http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/. The code is split into a library, which can be easily reused for other data and a small driver script for reproducing all results presented here.

abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16{\%} of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36{\%} of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group of cancers, and subtyping is necessary to better identify molecular-based therapies. In this study, we analyzed gene expression (GE) profiles from 21 breast cancer data sets and identified 587 TNBC cases. Cluster analysis identified 6 TNBC subtypes displaying unique GE and ontologies, including 2 basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Further, GE analysis allowed us to identify TNBC cell line models representative of these subtypes. Predicted "driver" signaling pathways were pharmacologically targeted in these cell line models as proof of concept that analysis of distinct GE signatures can inform therapy selection. BL1 and BL2 subtypes had higher expression of cell cycle and DNA damage response genes, and representative cell lines preferentially responded to cisplatin. M and MSL subtypes were enriched in GE for epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and growth factor pathways and cell models responded to NVP-BEZ235 (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and dasatinib (an abl/src inhibitor). The LAR subtype includes patients with decreased relapse-free survival and was characterized by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. LAR cell lines were uniquely sensitive to bicalutamide (an AR antagonist). These data may be useful in biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial design that will enable alignment of TNBC patients to appropriate targeted therapies.},

Disruption of epigenetic regulation is a common event in human cancer. Here, we review the key protein families that arbitrate epigenetic signaling through writing, erasing or reading specific post-translational modifications. By exploiting the leading role of epigenetics in tumor development and the reversibility of epigenetic modifications, promising novel epigenetic-based therapies are being developed. In this article, we highlight the emerging small-molecule inhibitors targeting each class of chromatin-associated protein, their current use in preclinical and clinical trials and their perspectives for being approved in the near future.},

High-content screening studies typically generate immense datasets of image-based phenotypic information, and how best to mine relevant phenotypic data is an unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce factor analysis as a data-driven tool for defining cell phenotypes and profiling compound activities. This method allows a large data reduction while retaining relevant information, and the data-derived factors used to quantify phenotype have discernable biological meaning. We used factor analysis of cells stained with fluorescent markers of cell cycle state to profile a compound library and cluster the hits into seven phenotypic categories. We then compared phenotypic profiles, chemical similarity and predicted protein binding activities of active compounds. By integrating these different descriptors of measured and potential biological activity, we can effectively draw mechanism-of-action inferences.},

When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinrates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as D2 with a singular dispersion matrix.},

abstract = {The functions of aminotelopeptide and N-terminal cross-linking of collagen I were examined. Acetic acid-soluble collagen I (ASC) was purified from neonatal bovine skin and treated with three kinds of proteases. The amino acid sequencing analysis of the N terminus showed that ASC contained a full-length aminotelopeptide. Pepsin and papain cleaved the aminotelopeptide of the alpha1 chain at the same site and the aminotelopeptide of the alpha2 chain at different sites. Proctase-treated ASC lost the whole aminotelopeptide, and the N-terminal sequence began from the tenth residue inside the triple helical region. The rates of fibril formation of pepsin-treated ASC and proctase-treated ASC were the same and were slower than that of ASC. The denaturation temperatures, monitored by CD ellipticity at 221 nm, of ASC, pepsin-treated, or papain-treated collagens were the same at 41.8 degrees C. Proctase-treated ASC showed a lower denaturation temperature of 39.9 degrees C. We also observed the morphology of the collagen fibrils under an electron microscope. The ASC fibrils were straight and thin, whereas the fibrils of pepsin-treated ASC were slightly twisted, and the fibrils from papain- and proctase-treated ASC were highly twisted and thick. When the collagen gel strength was examined by a modified method of viscosity-measurement, ASC was the strongest, followed by pepsin-treated ASC, and papain- and proctase-treated ASCs were the weakest. These results suggest that the aminotelopeptide plays important roles in fibril formation and thermal stability. In addition, the functions of intermolecular cross-linking in aminotelopeptides may contribute to the formation of fibrils in the correct staggered pattern and to strengthening the collagen gel.},

In our previous studies, genetically distinct noncollagenous (NC) domains of type-IV collagen were shown to interact with integrin receptors expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Moreover, these NC1 domains were shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Here, we provide evidence that a recombinant form of the alpha2(IV)NC1 domain of type-IV collagen could bind integrins alpha1beta1 and alphavbeta3 expressed on melanoma cells and inhibit tumor cell adhesion in a ligand-specific manner. Systemic administration of recombinant alpha2(IV)NC1 domain potently inhibited M21 melanoma tumor growth within full thickness human skin and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice. Interestingly, alpha2(IV)NC1 domain enhanced cellular senescence in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that recombinant alpha2(IV)NC1 domain is not only a potent anti-angiogenic reagent, but it also directly impacts tumor cell behavior. Thus, alpha2(IV)NC1 domain represents a potent inhibitor of tumor growth by impacting both endothelial and tumor cell compartments.},

abstract = {It is known that the extracellular matrix regulates normal cell proliferation, and it is assumed that anchorage-independent malignant cells escape this regulatory function. Here we demonstrate that human M24met melanoma cells remain responsive to growth regulatory signals that result from contact with type I collagen and that the effect on proliferation depends on the physical structure of the collagen. On polymerized fibrillar collagen, M24met cells are growth arrested at the G(1)/S checkpoint and maintain high levels of p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein. In contrast, on nonfibrillar (denatured) collagen, the cells enter the cell cycle, and p27(KIP1) is down-regulated. These growth regulatory effects involve contact between type I collagen and the collagen-binding integrin alpha(2)beta(1), which appears restricted in the presence of fibrillar collagen. Thus melanoma cells remain sensitive to negative growth regulatory signals originating from fibrillar collagen, and the proteolytic degradation of fibrils is a mechanism allowing tumor cells to escape these restrictive signals.},

Two components of the cellular response to a basement membrane overlay that result in the expression of the milk protein beta-casein were defined. The first component of this response involves a rounding and clustering of the cells that can be physically mimicked by plating the cells on a nonadhesive substratum. The second component is biochemical in nature, and it is associated with beta 1 integrin clustering and increased tyrosine phosphorylation. The second component is initiated in a morphology-independent manner, but the proper translation of this biochemical signal into a functional response requires cell rounding and cell clustering. Thus, physical and biochemical signal transduction events contribute to the ECM-dependent regulation of tissue-specific gene expression in mouse mammary epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Metastases can develop after apparently successful treatment of a primary tumour, sometimes following a period of tumour dormancy that can last for years. However, factors that regulate metastatic tumour dormancy remain poorly understood. Here we review the potential contribution of interactions between tumour cells and the microenvironment in metastatic sites, in regulating tumour dormancy vs. metastatic growth. We focus particularly on the potential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulating maintenance and release from dormancy. Tumour cells that fail to properly adhere to the ECM may enter a state of dormancy. The molecular and physical composition of the ECM can be affected by tumour cells themselves, as well as multiple stromal cell types. The roles of integrins, fibronectin, and collagen are discussed, as are factors that can change the ECM. A better understanding of the molecular details of the crosstalk between tumour cells and the ECM in secondary sites, and how these regulate the dormant state, may lead to improved therapeutic strategies to induce or maintain disseminated tumour cells in a dormant state, or alternatively to successfully eradicate dormant cells. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Extracellular pH (pH(e)) is lower in many tumors than in the corresponding normal tissue. The significance of acidic pH(e) in the development of metastatic disease was investigated in the present work. Human melanoma cells (A-07, D-12, and T-22) were cultured in vitro at pH(e) 6.8 or 7.4 (control) before being inoculated into the tail vein of BALB/c nu/nu mice for formation of experimental pulmonary metastases. Cell invasiveness was studied in vitro by using Matrigel invasion chambers and angiogenesis was studied in vivo by using an intradermal assay. Protein secretion was measured by ELISA and immunocapture assays. Cells cultured at acidic pH(e) showed increased secretion of proteinases and proangiogenic factors, enhanced invasive and angiogenic potential, and enhanced potential to develop experimental metastases. Acidity-induced metastasis was inhibited by treatment with the general matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001, the general cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64, or blocking antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) or interleukin-8 (IL-8). Our study indicates that acidic pH(e) promotes experimental pulmonary metastasis in A-07, D-12, and T-22 human melanoma cells by a common mechanism involving acidity-induced up-regulation of the proteolytic enzymes MMP-2, MMP-9, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L and acidity-induced up-regulation of the proangiogenic factors VEGF-A and IL-8. One consequence of this observation is that treatment strategies involving deliberate tumor acidification to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and hyperthermia should be avoided. Moreover, the possibility that the pH(e) of the primary tumor may be an important prognostic parameter for melanoma patients merits clinical investigation.},

abstract = {Active matrix metalloproteinases and degraded collagen are observed in disease states, such as atherosclerosis. To examine whether degraded collagen fragments have distinct effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), collagenase-digested type I collagen was added to cultured human arterial SMC. After addition of collagen fragments, adherent SMC lose their focal adhesion structures and round up. Analysis of components of the focal adhesion complex demonstrates rapid cleavage of the focal adhesion kinase (pp125(FAK)), paxillin, and talin. Cleavage is suppressed by inhibitors of the proteolytic enzyme, calpain I. In vitro translated pp125(FAK) is a substrate for both calpain I- and II-mediated processing. Mapping of the proteolytic cleavage fragments of pp125(FAK) predicts a dissociation of the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence and second proline-rich domain from the tyrosine kinase domain and integrin-binding sequence. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirm that the ability of pp125(FAK) to associate with paxillin, vinculin, and p130cas is significantly reduced in SMC treated with degraded collagen fragments. Further, there is a significant reduction in the association of intact pp125(FAK) with the cytoskeletal fraction, while pp125(FAK) cleavage fragments appear in the cytoplasm in SMC treated with degraded collagen fragments. Integrin-blocking studies indicate that integrin-mediated signals are involved in degraded collagen induction of pp125(FAK) cleavage. Thus, collagen fragments induce distinct integrin signals that lead to initiation of calpain-mediated cleavage of pp125(FAK), paxillin, and talin and dissolution of the focal adhesion complex.},
annote = {Intracelular signalling induced by the ECM may be mediated through the focal adhesion complex. Focal adhesions are sites of integrein-ECM adhesion. They consist of numerous signalling proteins and the cytoplasmic tail of beta integrins which serve as a physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton.

FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that localises to focal adhesions and may play an important role in the integration of signals from integrins and growth factors.

The ppFAK125 protein can be divided into 3 parts; an NH2-terminal integrin binding domain consisting of two proline-rich motifs and a focal adhesion targeting sequence required to association with other focal adhesion proteins (p130cas, paxillin, talin). ppFAK125 also contains sites of tyrosine phosphorylation involved in binding to the SH2 domains of PI3K and Grb2. Through these domains ppFAK125 recruits signalling molecules to the focal adhesion complex and transduces downstream signals derived from integrin-ECM interactions.},

@article{Sodek2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The invasive potential of cancer cells is usually assessed in vitro using Matrigel as a surrogate basement membrane. Yet cancer cell interaction with collagen I matrices is critical, particularly for the peritoneal metastatic route undertaken by several cancer types including ovarian. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity is important to enable cells to overcome the barrier constraints imposed by basement membranes and stromal matrices in vivo. Our objective was to compare matrices reconstituted from collagen I and Matrigel as representative barriers for ovarian cancer cell invasion. METHODS: The requirement of MMP activity for ovarian cancer cell penetration of Matrigel and collagen matrices was assessed in 2D transwell and 3D spheroid culture systems. RESULTS: The broad range MMP inhibitor GM6001 completely prevented cell perforation of polymerised collagen I-coated transwell membranes. In contrast, GM6001 decreased ES-2 cell penetration of Matrigel by only approximately 30{\%} and had no effect on HEY cell Matrigel penetration. In 3D culture, ovarian cancer cells grown as spheroids also migrated into surrounding Matrigel matrices despite MMP blockade. In contrast, MMP activity was required for invasion into 3D matrices of collagen I reconstituted from acid-soluble rat-tail collagen I, but not from pepsin-extracted collagen I (Vitrogen/Purecol), which lacks telopeptide regions. CONCLUSION: Matrigel does not form representative barriers to ovarian cancer cells in either 2D or 3D culture systems. Our findings support the use of collagen I rather than Matrigel as a matrix barrier for invasion studies to better approximate critical interactions and events associated with peritoneal metastasis.},

- S, G2 and mitotic cells are green

Mixed fluorescent cells with non-fluorescent cell lines to decrease fluorescent cell density and increase accuracy.

Nuclei segmentation
-------------------------

- Difficult in 3D intravital images due to high cell density and variability in nuclei size, shape and appearance.

- Their solution couples marker-controlled watersheds with novel supervised hierachical learning based region-merging method.

- Nuclei were segmented without cell-cycle information

1. locally adaptive thresholding algorithm to obtain coarse foreground-background segmentation.
2. Detect seed points in nuclei using 3D extension of a scale-adaptive multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter, and used them as markers for a marker-controlled watershed algorithm to obtain an initial segmentation result.

- Intentionally over-segmented the nuclei, and then corrected this with a supervised hierachical learning based algorithm that finds all pairs of spatially adjacent regions and presents them to a discriminative two-class classification model based on image derived features. The pairs of the classifier recommends for merging are iteratively mergedd in decreased order of merge probability.

Automated cell-cycle state identification
--------------------------------------------------

- Developed a fully automated supervised classification scheme to identify the cell-cycle state of each detected cell on the basis of image-derived features extracted from the cell-cycle reporter.

- Built a 4-class model that associates a given cell with:
- G1
- late G1/early S
- S/G2
- mitosis

- Then built a coarser, more accurate, classification scheme on two-classes:
- interphase (G1 + late G1/early S + S/G2) versus mitosis
- G1 versus S + G2 + mitosis


Quantitative analysis of cancer drug effects in space and time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Used the workflow to track the effects of cancer therapeutics on cell-cycle progression.

- Analysed the single-cell dynamics of paclitaxel treatment

- An overall downward trend in cell density after treatment. Cell-cycle state quantification showed that mitotic cells cells accumulated after drug injection, peaking on day 2. Cell-cycle arrest was much more modest in the 3D assay compared to that of the 2D cultures.

This gap analysis has reviewed and critically assessed enduring issues and new challenges emerging from recent research, and proposes strategies for translating solutions into practice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: More than 100 internationally recognised specialist breast cancer scientists, clinicians and healthcare professionals collaborated to address nine thematic areas: genetics, epigenetics and epidemiology; molecular pathology and cell biology; hormonal influences and endocrine therapy; imaging, detection and screening; current/novel therapies and biomarkers; drug resistance; metastasis, angiogenesis, circulating tumour cells, cancer 'stem' cells; risk and prevention; living with and managing breast cancer and its treatment. The groups developed summary papers through an iterative process which, following further appraisal from experts and patients, were melded into this summary account.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The 10 major gaps identified were: (1) understanding the functions and contextual interactions of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal breast development and during malignant transformation; (2) how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight) and chemopreventive strategies; (3) the need for tailored screening approaches including clinically actionable tests; (4) enhancing knowledge of molecular drivers behind breast cancer subtypes, progression and metastasis; (5) understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity, dormancy, de novo or acquired resistance and how to target key nodes in these dynamic processes; (6) developing validated markers for chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity; (7) understanding the optimal duration, sequencing and rational combinations of treatment for improved personalised therapy; (8) validating multimodality imaging biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis and monitoring of responses in primary and metastatic disease; (9) developing interventions and support to improve the survivorship experience; (10) a continuing need for clinical material for translational research derived from normal breast, blood, primary, relapsed, metastatic and drug-resistant cancers with expert bioinformatics support to maximise its utility. The proposed infrastructural enablers include enhanced resources to support clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumour models; improved access to appropriate, fully annotated clinical samples; extended biomarker discovery, validation and standardisation; and facilitated cross-discipline working.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With resources to conduct further high-quality targeted research focusing on the gaps identified, increased knowledge translating into improved clinical care should be achievable within five years.},

Sophisticated 3D multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) systems provide an emerging tool to model the phenotypic and cellular heterogeneity as well as microenvironmental aspects of in vivo tumor growth. In this review we discuss the cellular, chemical and physical factors contributing to zonation and cellular crosstalk within tumor masses. On this basis, we further describe 3D cell culture technologies for growth of MCTS as advanced tools for exploring molecular tumor growth determinants and facilitating drug discovery efforts. We conclude with a synopsis on technological aspects for on-line analysis and post-processing of 3D MCTS models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Tumor metastasis involves a progressive loss of tissue architecture and dissolution of structural boundaries between the epithelium and connective tissue. The basement membrane (BM), a specialized network of extracellular matrix proteins forms a barrier that physically restricts pre-invasive lesions such that they remain as local insults. The BM is not a static structure, but one that is constantly regenerated and remodeled in the adult organism. Matrix organization also regulates cell function. Thus alterations in the balance of synthesis, remodeling and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins may contribute to a loss of structural integrity. However, the de novo assembly and maintenance of the complex structural properties of in vivo basement membranes remain elusive. Here, this paper highlights the current understanding on the structural properties and the establishment of the BM, and discusses the potential role of self-generated forces in adult tissue remodeling and the maintenance of the BM as a malignancy suppressor.},

Although the importance of extracellular matrix interactions in metastasis is well documented, systematic approaches to identify their roles in distinct stages of tumorigenesis have not been described. Here we report a novel-screening platform capable of measuring phenotypic responses to combinations of extracellular matrix molecules. Using a genetic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we measure the extracellular matrix-dependent adhesion of tumour-derived cells. Hierarchical clustering of the adhesion profiles differentiates metastatic cell lines from primary tumour lines. Furthermore, we uncovered that metastatic cells selectively associate with fibronectin when in combination with galectin-3, galectin-8 or laminin. We show that these molecules correlate with human disease and that their interactions are mediated in part by $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin. Thus, our platform allowed us to interrogate interactions between metastatic cells and their microenvironments, and identified extracellular matrix and integrin interactions that could serve as therapeutic targets.},

Unlike tumor cells, stromal cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are genetically stable and thus represent an attractive therapeutic target with reduced risk of resistance and tumor recurrence. However, specifically disrupting the pro-tumorigenic TME is a challenging undertaking, as the TME has diverse capacities to induce both beneficial and adverse consequences for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, many studies have shown that the microenvironment is capable of normalizing tumor cells, suggesting that re-education of stromal cells, rather than targeted ablation per se, may be an effective strategy for treating cancer.

These proteins are expressed dynamically and their cellular functions are highly dependent upon cues from the local environment. Recent studies have shown an increasing appreciation of the key roles these ECM proteins play within the tumour microenvironment. Induced by either tumour cells or tumour stromal components, matricellular proteins initiate downstream signalling events that lead to proliferation, invasion, matrix remodelling and dissemination to pre-metastatic niches in other organs. In this review, we summarise and discuss the current knowledge of the diverse roles these proteins play within the microenvironment that influences tumour progression and potential for future therapies targeting the tumour microenvironment.},
annote = {Matricellular proteins: non-structural ECM proteins that modulate cell-matrix interactions and cell regulatory functions by different mechanisms.

These proteins exert their funcitons by either binding to cell surface receptors, or binding to other ECM proteins to form a scaffold that can trigger extracellular signalling pathways for upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and other growth factors.

Members of this family:
- osteopontin (OPN)
- periostin (POSTN)
- secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)
- tenascin C (TNC)

In cancer, overexpression of matricellular proteins by activated fibroblasts or malignant cells can potentiate pro-tumorigenic interactionsin the tumour microenvironment.

-------------------------------------------

POSTN is a secreted TGF-beta inducible protein that binds to several ECM proteins (collagen-I, integrins - activating PKB/Akt), shown an increase the metastatic potential, stimulates EMT, and increases cell survival in a number of cancer cell lines. 

TNC is modulated by beta-catenin, knock-down of TNC in breast cancer cell lines has shown to devrease cell migration in vitro, and also reduce formation of metastases in vivo.

OPN can induce cell motility and invasion, binds to a number of cellular receptors such as integrins, CD44. OPN is found upregulated in epithelial cancers, secreted into the ECM where is mediates cell-matrix interactions to initiate cell signalling via EGFR, c-MET, or induce cell proliferation and migration.

SPARC binds directly to components within the ECM such as collagen-I/III and integrein receptors (a4b4, b1 and b5). SPARC also binds directly to VEGF. SPARC is broadly anti-proliferative, de-adhesive and promotes cell-ECM interactions. SPARC overexpression in normal melanoma cells reduces E-cadherin expression and induces EMT through upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as Snail.

Given that oncology is currently the most active therapeutic area, and also one in which target-focused approaches have been particularly prominent in the past two decades, we investigated the contribution of phenotypic assays to oncology drug discovery by analysing the origins of all new small-molecule cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the past 15 years and those currently in clinical development. Although the majority of these drugs originated from target-based discovery, we identified a significant number whose discovery depended on phenotypic screening approaches. We postulate that the contribution of phenotypic screening to cancer drug discovery has been hampered by a reliance on 'classical' nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity and mitotic arrest, exacerbated by a paucity of mechanistically defined cellular models for therapeutically translatable cancer phenotypes. However, technical and biological advances that enable such mechanistically informed phenotypic models have the potential to empower phenotypic drug discovery in oncology.},

Since their discovery nearly 20 years ago, Aurora kinases have been studied extensively in cell and cancer biology. Several early studies found that Aurora kinases are amplified and overexpressed at the transcript and protein level in various malignancies, including several types of leukemia. These discoveries and others provided a rationale for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases as leukemia therapies. The first generation of Aurora kinase inhibitors did not fare well in clinical trials, owing to poor efficacy and high toxicity. However, the creation of second-generation, highly selective Aurora kinase inhibitors has increased the enthusiasm for targeting these proteins in leukemia. This review will describe the functions of each Aurora kinase, summarize their involvement in leukemia and discuss inhibitor development and efficacy in leukemia clinical trials.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 March 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.14.},

abstract = {Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in the cross-talk and mediation of many signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis. Increased Src activity has been reported in many types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.},

abstract = {Epigenetic alterations in the cancer methylome are common in breast cancer and provide novel options for tumour stratification. Here, we perform whole-genome methylation capture sequencing on small amounts of DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and matched normal samples. We identify dif- ferentially methylated regions (DMRs) enriched with promoters associated with transcription factor binding sites and DNA hypersensitive sites. Importantly, we stratify TNBCs into three distinct methylation clusters associated with better or worse prognosis and identify 17 DMRs that show a strong association with overall survival, including DMRs located in the Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) gene, bi-directional-promoter and antisense WT1-AS. Our data reveal that coordinated hypermethylation can occur in oestrogen receptor-negative disease, and that characterizing the epigenetic framework provides a potential signature to stratify TNBCs. Together, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of profiling the cancer methylome with limited archival tissue to identify regulatory regions associated with cancer.},

abstract = {High-throughput screening, based on subcellular imaging, has become a powerful tool in lead discovery. Through the generation of high-quality images, not only the specific target signal can be analyzed but also phenotypic changes of the whole cell are recorded. Yet analysis strategies for the exploration of high-content screening results, in a manner that is independent from predefined control phenotypes, are largely missing. The approach presented here is based on a well-established modeling technique, self-organizing maps (SOMs), which uses multiparametric results to group treatments that create similar morphological effects. This report describes a novel visualization of the SOM clustering by using an image of the cells from each node, with the most representative cell highlighted to deploy the phenotype described by each node. The approach has the potential to identify both expected hits and novel cellular phenotypes. Moreover, different chemotypes, which cause the same phenotypic effects, are identified, thus facilitating "scaffold hopping."},

Here we ask how trade-offs affect the range of phenotypes found in nature. Using the Pareto front concept from economics and engineering, we find that best-trade-off phenotypes are weighted averages of archetypes--phenotypes specialized for single tasks. For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.},

We propose that the topology of these landscapes is in large part determined by cell-intrinsic factors, such as biophysical constraints on cytoskeletal organization, and reflects different stable signaling and/or transcriptional states. Cell-extrinsic factors act to determine how cells explore these landscapes, and the topology of the landscapes themselves. Informational stimuli primarily drive transitions between stable states by engaging signaling networks, while mechanical stimuli tune, or even radically alter, the topology of these landscapes. As environments fluctuate, the topology of morphological landscapes explored by cells dynamically adapts to these fluctuations. Finally we hypothesize how complex cellular and tissue morphologies can be generated from a limited number of simple cell shapes.},

Here we describe a protocol consisting of experimental and computational steps to identify the cellular pathways modulated by chemicals, and their mechanism of action. The multiparametric profiles from a 'query' chemical screen are used as constraints to select genes with similar profiles from a 'reference' genetic screen. In our case, the query screen is the intracellular survival of mycobacteria and the reference is a genome-wide RNAi screen of endocytosis. The two disparate screens are bridged by an 'intermediate' chemical screen of endocytosis, so that the similarity in the multiparametric profiles between the chemical and the genetic perturbations can generate a testable hypothesis of the cellular pathways modulated by the chemicals. This approach is not assay specific, but it can be broadly applied to various quantitative, multiparametric data sets. Generation of the query system takes 3-6 weeks, and data analysis and integration with the reference data set takes an 3 additional weeks.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: One of the important aspects of the data classification problem lies in making the most appropriate selection of features. The set of variables should be small and, at the same time, should provide reliable discrimination of the classes. The method for the discriminating power evaluation that enables a comparison between different sets of variables will be useful in the search for the set of variables.

RESULTS: A new approach to feature selection is presented. Two methods of evaluation of the data discriminating power of a feature set are suggested. Both of the methods implement self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the newly introduced exponents of the degree of data clusterization on the SOM. The first method is based on the comparison of intraclass and interclass distances on the map. Another method concerns the evaluation of the relative number of best matching unit's (BMUs) nearest neighbors of the same class. Both methods make it possible to evaluate the discriminating power of a feature set in cases when this set provides nonlinear discrimination of the classes.

@article{Sisan2012,
abstract = {We develop a potential landscape approach to quantitatively describe experimental data from a fibroblast cell line that exhibits a wide range of GFP expression levels under the control of the promoter for tenascin-C. Time-lapse live-cell microscopy provides data about short-term fluctuations in promoter activity, and flow cytometry measurements provide data about the long-term kinetics, because isolated subpopulations of cells relax from a relatively narrow distribution of GFP expression back to the original broad distribution of responses. The landscape is obtained from the steady state distribution of GFP expression and connected to a potential-like function using a stochastic differential equation description (Langevin/Fokker-Planck). The range of cell states is constrained by a force that is proportional to the gradient of the potential, and biochemical noise causes movement of cells within the landscape. Analyzing the mean square displacement of GFP intensity changes in live cells indicates that these fluctuations are described by a single diffusion constant in log GFP space. This finding allows application of the Kramers' model to calculate rates of switching between two attractor states and enables an accurate simulation of the dynamics of relaxation back to the steady state with no adjustable parameters. With this approach, it is possible to use the steady state distribution of phenotypes and a quantitative description of the short-term fluctuations in individual cells to accurately predict the rates at which different phenotypes will arise from an isolated subpopulation of cells.},

abstract = {When investigators monitor effects on a population of cells following a perturbation, these events rarely occur in a classical normal (or Gaussian) distribution. A normal distribution is, however, explicitly assumed for events within a single well, in which mean values per well are used as an assay metric and, in general, measures of assay robustness, such as the Z' score and the V factor. Such analysis is not possible for many technologies; however, high-content screening (HCS) measures events of individual cells, which are averaged over the well. These individual cell-level measurements may be analyzed separately. This study quantifies the extent of nonnormality in experimental samples and their effects on determining the EC50 of a test compound and the assay robustness statistics. The results, based on five sets of publicly available data, indicate that the Z' or V-factor score can be improved by as much as 0.44 more than standard calculations, and the EC50 of a dose-response curve can be lowered by as much as fivefold when nonparametric methods are used, but not all data sets show a significant improvement. The effect on analysis depends in part on whether the greatest shift from normality occurs in the upper or lower range of the dose-response curve.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated, image based high-content screening is a fundamental tool for discovery in biological science. Modern robotic fluorescence microscopes are able to capture thousands of images from massively parallel experiments such as RNA interference (RNAi) or small-molecule screens. As such, efficient computational methods are required for automatic cellular phenotype identification capable of dealing with large image data sets. In this paper we investigated an efficient method for the extraction of quantitative features from images by combining second order statistics, or Haralick features, with curvelet transform. A random subspace based classifier ensemble with multiple layer perceptron (MLP) as the base classifier was then exploited for classification. Haralick features estimate image properties related to second-order statistics based on the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), which has been extensively used for various image processing applications. The curvelet transform has a more sparse representation of the image than wavelet, thus offering a description with higher time frequency resolution and high degree of directionality and anisotropy, which is particularly appropriate for many images rich with edges and curves. A combined feature description from Haralick feature and curvelet transform can further increase the accuracy of classification by taking their complementary information. We then investigate the applicability of the random subspace (RS) ensemble method for phenotype classification based on microscopy images. A base classifier is trained with a RS sampled subset of the original feature set and the ensemble assigns a class label by majority voting.

RESULTS: Experimental results on the phenotype recognition from three benchmarking image sets including HeLa, CHO and RNAi show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The combined feature is better than any individual one in the classification accuracy. The ensemble model produces better classification performance compared to the component neural networks trained. For the three images sets HeLa, CHO and RNAi, the Random Subspace Ensembles offers the classification rates 91.20{\%}, 98.86{\%} and 91.03{\%} respectively, which compares sharply with the published result 84{\%}, 93{\%} and 82{\%} from a multi-purpose image classifier WND-CHARM which applied wavelet transforms and other feature extraction methods. We investigated the problem of estimation of ensemble parameters and found that satisfactory performance improvement could be brought by a relative medium dimensionality of feature subsets and small ensemble size.

CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of curvelet transform of being multiscale and multidirectional suit the description of microscopy images very well. It is empirically demonstrated that the curvelet-based feature is clearly preferred to wavelet-based feature for bioimage descriptions.

abstract = {Recent advances in microscope automation provide new opportunities for high-throughput cell biology, such as image-based screening. High-complex image analysis tasks often make the implementation of static and predefined processing rules a cumbersome effort. Machine-learning methods, instead, seek to use intrinsic data structure, as well as the expert annotations of biologists to infer models that can be used to solve versatile data analysis tasks. Here, we explain how machine-learning methods work and what needs to be considered for their successful application in cell biology. We outline how microscopy images can be converted into a data representation suitable for machine learning, and then introduce various state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms, highlighting recent applications in image-based screening. Our Commentary aims to provide the biologist with a guide to the application of machine learning to microscopy assays and we therefore include extensive discussion on how to optimize experimental workflow as well as the data analysis pipeline.},

abstract = {High-content screening (HCS) is a powerful tool for drug discovery being capable of measuring cellular responses to chemical disturbance in a high-throughput manner. HCS provides an image-based readout of cellular phenotypes, including features such as shape, intensity, or texture in a highly multiplexed and quantitative manner. The corresponding feature vectors can be used to characterize phenotypes and are thus defined as HCS fingerprints. Systematic analyses of HCS fingerprints allow for objective computational comparisons of cellular responses. Such comparisons therefore facilitate the detection of different compounds with different phenotypic outcomes from high-throughput HCS campaigns. Feature selection methods and similarity measures, as a basis for phenotype identification and clustering, are critical for the quality of such computational analyses. We systematically evaluated 16 different similarity measures in combination with linear and nonlinear feature selection methods for their potential to capture biologically relevant image features. Nonlinear correlation-based similarity measures such as Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's $\rho$ perform well in most evaluation scenarios, outperforming other frequently used metrics (such as the Euclidian distance). We also present four novel modifications of the connectivity map similarity that surpass the original version, in our experiments. This study provides a basis for generic phenotypic analysis in future HCS campaigns.},

Such advances in assay technologies highlight the complex nature of biology and disease. Harnessing this complexity requires integration of all the different parameters that can be measured rather than just monitoring a single dimension as is commonly used. Although some of the methods used to combine multiple measurements, such as principal component analysis, are commonly used for microarray analysis, biologists are not yet using many of the tools that have been developed in other fields to address such issues. Visualization of multiparametric data sets is one of the major challenges in this field, and a depiction of the results in a manner that can be readily interpreted is essential. This article describes a number of assay systems being used to generate such data sets en masse, and the methods being applied to their visualization and analysis. We also discuss some of the challenges of applying methods developed in other fields to biology.},

abstract = {Methods for numerical description and subsequent classification of cellular protein localization patterns are described. Images representing the localization patterns of 4 proteins and DNA were obtained using fluorescence microscopy and divided into distinct training and test sets. The images were processed to remove out-of-focus and background fluorescence and 2 sets of numeric features were generated: Zernike moments and Haralick texture features. These feature sets were used as inputs to either a classification tree or a neural network. Classifier performance (the average percent of each type of image correctly classified) on previously unseen images ranged from 63{\%} for a classification tree using Zernike moments to 88{\%} for a backpropagation neural network using a combination of features from the 2 feature sets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying pattern recognition methods to subcellular localization patterns, enabling sets of previously unseen images from a single class to be classified with an expected accuracy greater than 99{\%}. This will provide not only a new automated way to describe proteins, based on localization rather than sequence, but also has potential application in the automation of microscope functions and in the field of gene discovery.},

Prediction problems are divided into two categories: sparse classification and sparse regression. In classification, the clinical parameter to be predicted is binary, whereas in regression, the parameter is a real number. Well-known methods for both classes of problems are briefly discussed. These include the SVM (support vector machine) for classification and various algorithms such as ridge regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and EN (elastic net) for regression. In addition, several well-established methods that do not directly fall into machine learning theory are also reviewed, including neural networks, PAM (pattern analysis for microarrays), SAM (significance analysis for microarrays), GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis), and k-means clustering. Several references indicative of the application of these methods to cancer biology are discussed.

abstract = {Image analysis algorithms are often highly parameterized and much human input is needed to optimize parameter settings. This incurs a time cost of up to several days. We analyze and characterize the conventional parameter optimization process for image analysis and formulate user requirements. With this as input, we propose a change in paradigm by optimizing parameters based on parameter sampling and interactive visual exploration. To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step--initialization of sampling--and the last step--visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler--a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values. User-defined areas of interest are presented in a structured way that includes image-based output and a novel layout algorithm. To find optimal parameter settings, users can tag high- and low-quality results to refine their search. We include two case studies to illustrate the utility of this approach.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Metastasis is responsible for the greatest number of cancer deaths. Metastatic disease, or the movement of cancer cells from one site to another, is a complex process requiring dramatic remodelling of the cell cytoskeleton. The various components of the cytoskeleton, actin (microfilaments), microtubules (MTs) and intermediate filaments, are highly integrated and their functions are well orchestrated in normal cells. In contrast, mutations and abnormal expression of cytoskeletal and cytoskeletal-associated proteins play an important role in the ability of cancer cells to resist chemotherapy and metastasize. Studies on the role of actin and its interacting partners have highlighted key signalling pathways, such as the Rho GTPases, and downstream effector proteins that, through the cytoskeleton, mediate tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis. An emerging role for MTs in tumour cell metastasis is being unravelled and there is increasing interest in the crosstalk between key MT interacting proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, which may provide novel treatment avenues for metastatic disease. Improved understanding of how the cytoskeleton and its interacting partners influence tumour cell migration and metastasis has led to the development of novel therapeutics against aggressive and metastatic disease.

The goal of this study was to understand the role cadherin switching plays in EMT using a classical model system: transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-mediated EMT in mammary epithelial cells. We showed that stress fibers and focal adhesions are increased, and cell-cell junctions are decreased in response to TGF-beta1. Moreover, these changes were reversible upon removal of TGF-beta1. Downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin were both transcriptional. Neither experimental knockdown nor experimental overexpression of N-cadherin interfered with the morphological changes. In addition, the morphological changes associated with EMT preceded the downregulation of E-cadherin. Interestingly, TGF-beta1-induced motility in N-cadherin-knockdown cells was significantly reduced. Together, these data suggest that cadherin switching is necessary for increased motility but is not required for the morphological changes that accompany EMT.},

@article{Chen2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is critical to understanding how that protein works in a cell. This location is frequently determined by the interpretation of fluorescence microscope images. In recent years, automated systems have been developed for consistent and objective interpretation of such images so that the protein pattern in a single cell can be assigned to a known location category. While these systems perform with nearly perfect accuracy for single cell images of all major subcellular structures, their ability to distinguish subpatterns of an organelle (such as two Golgi proteins) is not perfect. Our goal in the work described here was to improve the ability of an automated system to decide which of two similar patterns is present in a field of cells by considering more than one cell at a time. Since cells displaying the same location pattern are often clustered together, considering multiple cells may be expected to improve discrimination between similar patterns.

RESULTS: We describe how to take advantage of information on experimental conditions to construct a graphical representation for multiple cells in a field. Assuming that a field is composed of a small number of classes, the classification accuracy can be improved by allowing the computed probability of each pattern for each cell to be influenced by the probabilities of its neighboring cells in the model. We describe a novel way to allow this influence to occur, in which we adjust the prior probabilities of each class to reflect the patterns that are present. When this graphical model approach is used on synthetic multi-cell images in which the true class of each cell is known, we observe that the ability to distinguish similar classes is improved without suffering any degradation in ability to distinguish dissimilar classes. The computational complexity of the method is sufficiently low that improved assignments of classes can be obtained for fields of twelve cells in under 0.04 second on a 1600 megahertz processor.

CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that graphical models can be used to improve the accuracy of classification of subcellular patterns in multi-cell fluorescence microscope images. We also describe a novel algorithm for inferring classes from a graphical model. The performance and speed suggest that the method will be particularly valuable for analysis of images from high-throughput microscopy. We also anticipate that it will be useful for analyzing the mixtures of cell types typically present in images of tissues. Lastly, we anticipate that the method can be generalized to other problems.},

In this study we propose a novel approach which automatically compares the subcellular location of proteins between normal and cancerous tissues in order to identify proteins whose distribution is modified by oncogenesis. This study analyzes 258 proteins in 14 different cancer tissues and their corresponding normal tissues using images provided by the tissue microarray collection of the Human Protein Atlas. Using texture features automatically extracted from the tissue images, 14 machine classifiers were trained to recognize the patterns of eight major organelles in each tissue. For each tissue-protein combination, the results of the classifier for normal and cancerous tissues were compared. Eleven proteins were identified as showing differences in location; these proteins may have potential as biomarkers.},

Such models can also provide realistic geometry and initial protein locations to simulations in order to better understand cellular and subcellular processes. To determine the structures of cellular components and how proteins and other molecules are distributed among them, the generative modeling approach described here can be coupled with high throughput imaging technology to infer and represent subcellular organization from data with few a priori assumptions.

abstract = {Metastasis of tumor cells is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a process whereby epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire new features of mesenchyme. EMT has been reported to be induced by transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1), but its mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we performed a study to investigate whether PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathways involved in EMT in the human lung cancer A549 cells. The results showed that after treated with TGF-$\beta$1 for 48 h, A549 cells displayed more fibroblast-like shape, lost epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Fibronectin. Moreover, TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT after 48 h was accompanied by increased of cell migration and change of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, EMT was reversed by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, which suggested that A549 cells under stimulation of TGF-$\beta$1 undergo a switch into mesenchymal cells and PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathways serve to regulate TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT of A549 cells.},

abstract = {The molecular pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, is complex and not fully understood. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) plays a critical role in many fibrotic disorders, including DN. In this study, we report protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation as a downstream event contributing to the pathophysiology of DN. We investigated the potential of PKB/Akt to mediate the profibrotic bioactions of TGF-beta1 in kidney. Treatment of normal rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK52E) with TGF-beta1 resulted in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and PKB/Akt as evidenced by increased Ser473 phosphorylation and GSK-3beta phosphorylation. TGF-beta1 also stimulated increased Smad3 phosphorylation in these cells, a response that was insensitive to inhibition of PI3K or PKB/Akt. NRK52E cells displayed a loss of zona occludins 1 and E-cadherin and a gain in vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, consistent with the fibrotic actions of TGF-beta1. These effects were blocked with inhibitors of PI3K and PKB/Akt. Furthermore, overexpression of PTEN, the lipid phosphatase regulator of PKB/Akt activation, inhibited TGF-beta1-induced PKB/Akt activation. Interestingly, in the Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes, we also detected increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its downstream target, GSK-3beta, in the tubules, relative to that in control Wistar rats. Elevated Smad3 phosphorylation was also detected in kidney extracts from Goto-Kakizaki rats with chronic diabetes. Together, these data suggest that TGF-beta1-mediated PKB/Akt activation may be important in renal fibrosis during diabetic nephropathy.},

Although the Src family kinases (SFKs) are activated in various types of cancers, the exact mechanisms through which they contribute to the progression of individual tumors remain to be defined. The activation of Src in human cancers may occur through a variety of mechanisms that include domain interaction and structural remodeling in response to various activators or upstream kinases and phosphatastes. Because of Src's prominent roles in invasion and tumor progression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and the development of metastasis, Src is a promising target for cancer therapy. Several small molecule inhibitors of Src are currently being investigated in clinical trials. In this article, we will summarize the mechanisms regulating Src kinase activity in normal and cancer cells and discuss the status of Src inhibitor development against various types of cancers.},

Here, we present an ensemble approach using elastic net regularization combined with mRNA expression profiling and previously characterized data on a large set of kinase inhibitors to identify kinases that are important for epithelial and mesenchymal cell migration. By profiling a selected optimal set of 32 kinase inhibitors in a panel against six cell lines, we identified cell type-specific kinases that regulate cell migration. Our discovery of several informative kinases with a previously uncharacterized role in cell migration (such as Mst and Taok family of MAPK kinases in mesenchymal cells) may represent novel targets that warrant further investigation. Target deconvolution using our ensemble approach has the potential to aid in the rational design of more potent but less toxic drug combinations.},

abstract = {Large-scale analysis of cellular response to anticancer drugs typically focuses on variation in potency (half-maximum inhibitory concentration, (IC50)), assuming that it is the most important difference between effective and ineffective drugs or sensitive and resistant cells. We took a multiparametric approach involving analysis of the slope of the dose-response curve, the area under the curve and the maximum effect (Emax). We found that some of these parameters vary systematically with cell line and others with drug class. For cell-cycle inhibitors, Emax often but not always correlated with cell proliferation rate. For drugs targeting the Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway, dose-response curves were unusually shallow. Classical pharmacology has no ready explanation for this phenomenon, but single-cell analysis showed that it correlated with significant and heritable cell-to-cell variability in the extent of target inhibition. We conclude that parameters other than potency should be considered in the comparative analysis of drug response, particularly at clinically relevant concentrations near and above the IC50.},

abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event in the progression toward cancer metastasis. The intermediate filament protein vimentin is an important marker of EMT and a requisite regulator of mesenchymal cell migration. However, it is not known how vimentin functionally contributes to cancer cell invasion. Here, we report that ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Ras-V12G and Slug induces vimentin expression and migration in pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Conversely, vimentin expression is necessary for Slug- or H-Ras-V12G-induced EMT-associated migration. Furthermore, silencing of vimentin in breast epithelial cells results in specific changes in invasiveness-related gene expression including upregulation of RAB25 (small GTPase Rab25) and downregulation of AXL (receptor tyrosine kinase Axl), PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase) and ITGB4 (integrin $\beta$4-subunit). Importantly, gene expression profiling analyses reveal that vimentin expression correlates positively/negatively with these genes also in multiple breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient samples. Focusing on the tyrosine kinase Axl, we show that induction of vimentin by EMT is associated with upregulation of Axl expression and that Axl enhances the migratory activity of pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Using null and knock-down cells and overexpression models, we also show that regulation of breast cancer cell migration in two- and three-dimensional matrices by vimentin is Axl- dependent and that Axl functionally contributes to lung extravasation of breast cancer cells in mice. In conclusion, our data show that vimentin functionally contributes to EMT and is required for induction of Axl expression. Moreover, these results provide a molecular explanation for vimentin-dependent cancer cell migration during EMT by identifying Axl as a key proximal component in this process.},

abstract = {The lack of three-dimensional (3-D) high-throughput (HT) screening assays designed to identify anti-cancer invasion drugs is a major hurdle in reducing cancer-related mortality, with the key challenge being assay standardization. Presented is the development of a novel 3-D invasion assay with HT potential that involves surrounding cell-collagen spheres within collagen to create a 3-D environment through which cells can invade. Standardization was achieved by designing a tooled 96-well plate to create a precisely designated location for the cell-collagen spheres and by using dialdehyde dextran to inhibit collagen contraction, maintaining uniform size and shape. This permits automated readout for determination of the effect of inhibitory compounds on cancer cell invasion. Sensitivity was demonstrated by the ability to distinguish varying levels of invasiveness of cancer cell lines, and robustness was determined by calculating the Z-factor. A Z-factor of 0.65 was obtained by comparing the effects of DMSO and anti-$\beta$1-integrin antibody, an inhibitory reagent, on the invasion of Du145 cancer cells, suggesting this novel assay is suitable for large scale drug discovery. As proof of principle, the NCI Diversity Compound Library was screened against human invasive cancer cells. Nine compounds exhibiting high potency and low toxicity were identified, including DX-52-1, a compound previously reported to inhibit cell migration, a critical determinant of cancer invasion. The results indicate that this innovative HT platform is a simple, precise, and easy to replicate 3-D invasion assay for anti-cancer drug discovery.},

@article{Taddei2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular plasticity confers cancer cells the ability to adapt to microenvironmental changes, a fundamental requirement for tumour progression and metastasis. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transcriptional programme associated with increased cell motility and stemness. Besides EMT, the mesenchymal to amoeboid transition (MAT) has been described during tumour progression but to date, little is known about its transcriptional control and involvement in stemness. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate (i) the transcriptional profile associated with the MAT programme and (ii) to study whether MAT acquisition in melanoma cancer cells correlates with clonogenic potential to promote tumour growth.

RESULTS: By using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified four different treatments able to induce MAT in melanoma cells: EphA2 overexpression, Rac1 functional inhibition using its RacN17 dominant negative mutant, stimulation with Ilomastat or treatment with the RhoA activator Calpeptin. First, gene expression profiling identified the transcriptional pathways associated with MAT, independently of the stimulus that induces the MAT programme. Notably, gene sets associated with the repression of mesenchymal traits, decrease in the secretion of extracellular matrix components as well as increase of cellular stemness positively correlate with MAT. Second, the link between MAT and stemness has been investigated in vitro by analysing stemness markers and clonogenic potential of melanoma cells undergoing MAT. Finally, the link between MAT inducing treatments and tumour initiating capability has been validated in vivo.

CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that MAT programme in melanoma is characterised by increased stemness and clonogenic features of cancer cells, thus sustaining tumour progression. Furthermore, these data suggest that stemness is not an exclusive feature of cells undergoing EMT, but more generally is associated with an increase in cellular plasticity of cancer cells.},

abstract = {Retroviral insertional mutagenesis in mice is considered a powerful forward genetic strategy to identify disease genes involved in cancer. Our high-throughput screens led to frequent identification of the genes encoding the enzymes engaged in histone lysine methylation. Histone methylation can positively or negatively impact on gene transcription, and then fulfill important roles in developmental control and cell-fate decisions. A tremendous amount of progress has accelerated the characterization of histone methylations and the enzymes that regulate them. Deregulation of these histone methyl-modifying enzymes has been increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer in the last few years. However, in most cases, we have only limited understanding for the molecular mechanisms by which these enzymes contribute to cancer development and progression. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding some of the best-validated examples of histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases associated with oncogenesis and discuss their potential mechanisms of action.},

abstract = {Epigenetic effects are exerted by a variety of factors and evidence increases that common drugs such as opioids, cannabinoids, valproic acid, or cytostatics may induce alterations in DNA methylation patterns or histone conformations. These effects occur via chemical structural interactions with epigenetic enzymes, through interactions with DNA repair mechanisms. Computational predictions indicate that one-twentieth of all drugs might potentially interact with human histone deacetylase, which was prospectively experimentally verified for the compound with the highest predicted interaction probability. These epigenetic effects add to wanted and unwanted drug effects, contributing to mechanisms of drug resistance or disease-related and unrelated phenotypes. Because epigenetic changes might be transmitted to offspring, the need for reliable and cost-effective epigenetic screening tools becomes acute.},

@article{Gligorijevic2014,
abstract = {While it has been established that a number of microenvironment components can affect the likelihood of metastasis, the link between microenvironment and tumor cell phenotypes is poorly understood. Here we have examined microenvironment control over two different tumor cell motility phenotypes required for metastasis. By high-resolution multiphoton microscopy of mammary carcinoma in mice, we detected two phenotypes of motile tumor cells, different in locomotion speed. Only slower tumor cells exhibited protrusions with molecular, morphological, and functional characteristics associated with invadopodia. Each region in the primary tumor exhibited either fast- or slow-locomotion. To understand how the tumor microenvironment controls invadopodium formation and tumor cell locomotion, we systematically analyzed components of the microenvironment previously associated with cell invasion and migration. No single microenvironmental property was able to predict the locations of tumor cell phenotypes in the tumor if used in isolation or combined linearly. To solve this, we utilized the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify phenotypes in a nonlinear fashion. This approach identified conditions that promoted either motility phenotype. We then demonstrated that varying one of the conditions may change tumor cell behavior only in a context-dependent manner. In addition, to establish the link between phenotypes and cell fates, we photoconverted and monitored the fate of tumor cells in different microenvironments, finding that only tumor cells in the invadopodium-rich microenvironments degraded extracellular matrix (ECM) and disseminated. The number of invadopodia positively correlated with degradation, while the inhibiting metalloproteases eliminated degradation and lung metastasis, consistent with a direct link among invadopodia, ECM degradation, and metastasis. We have detected and characterized two phenotypes of motile tumor cells in vivo, which occurred in spatially distinct microenvironments of primary tumors. We show how machine-learning analysis can classify heterogeneous microenvironments in vivo to enable prediction of motility phenotypes and tumor cell fate. The ability to predict the locations of tumor cell behavior leading to metastasis in breast cancer models may lead towards understanding the heterogeneity of response to treatment.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and there are few effective treatments. GBMs contain cells with molecular and cellular characteristics of neural stem cells that drive tumour growth. Here we compare responses of human glioblastoma-derived neural stem (GNS) cells and genetically normal neural stem (NS) cells to a panel of 160 small molecule kinase inhibitors. We used live-cell imaging and high content image analysis tools and identified JNJ-10198409 (J101) as an agent that induces mitotic arrest at prometaphase in GNS cells but not NS cells. Antibody microarrays and kinase profiling suggested that J101 responses are triggered by suppression of the active phosphorylated form of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (phospho T210), with resultant spindle defects and arrest at prometaphase. We found that potent and specific Plk1 inhibitors already in clinical development (BI 2536, BI 6727 and GSK 461364) phenocopied J101 and were selective against GNS cells. Using a porcine brain endothelial cell blood-brain barrier model we also observed that these compounds exhibited greater blood-brain barrier permeability in vitro than J101. Our analysis of mouse mutant NS cells (INK4a/ARF(-/-), or p53(-/-)), as well as the acute genetic deletion of p53 from a conditional p53 floxed NS cell line, suggests that the sensitivity of GNS cells to BI 2536 or J101 may be explained by the lack of a p53-mediated compensatory pathway. Together these data indicate that GBM stem cells are acutely susceptible to proliferative disruption by Plk1 inhibitors and that such agents may have immediate therapeutic value.},

A standard screening-sized plate with an array of microchannels was designed and constructed from common thermoplastics. After filling the channels with 3D matrix, cells were placed at one end of the channel, and migration into the channel was monitored via an imaging system. All liquid-handling steps were performed by standard liquid-handling robotics. Tumor cell migration in the channel was truly 3D and correlated with metastatic potential. The information-rich data from these assays were used to rank the potency of compounds inhibiting migration through 3D collagen as well as to gain additional insights into the compounds' activities related to cell health.

Their properties and mechanisms of formation have become a major focus of current cancer research, in part because of their enhanced ability to initiate and drive tumour growth and their intrinsic resistance to conventional therapeutics. The discovery that activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme in carcinoma cells can give rise to cells with stem-like properties has provided one possible mechanism explaining how CSCs arise and presents a possible avenue for their therapeutic manipulation. Here we address recent developments in CSC research, focusing on carcinomas that are able to undergo EMT. We discuss the signalling pathways that create these cells, cell-intrinsic mechanisms that could be exploited for selective elimination or induction of their differentiation, and the role of the tumour microenvironment in sustaining them. Finally, we propose ways to use our current knowledge of the complex biology of CSCs to design novel therapies to eliminate them.},

We here report that the induction of an EMT in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLEs) results in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and in the expression of stem-cell markers. Furthermore, we show that those cells have an increased ability to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells. Independent of this, stem cell-like cells isolated from HMLE cultures form mammospheres and express markers similar to those of HMLEs that have undergone an EMT. Moreover, stem-like cells isolated either from mouse or human mammary glands or mammary carcinomas express EMT markers. Finally, transformed human mammary epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT form mammospheres, soft agar colonies, and tumors more efficiently. These findings illustrate a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties.},

abstract = {Cell migration through 3D tissue depends on a physicochemical balance between cell deformability and physical tissue constraints. Migration rates are further governed by the capacity to degrade ECM by proteolytic enzymes, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and integrin- and actomyosin-mediated mechanocoupling. Yet, how these parameters cooperate when space is confined remains unclear. Using MMP-degradable collagen lattices or nondegradable substrates of varying porosity, we quantitatively identify the limits of cell migration by physical arrest. MMP-independent migration declined as linear function of pore size and with deformation of the nucleus, with arrest reached at 10{\%} of the nuclear cross section (tumor cells, 7 µm²; T cells, 4 µm²; neutrophils, 2 µm²). Residual migration under space restriction strongly depended upon MMP-dependent ECM cleavage by enlarging matrix pore diameters, and integrin- and actomyosin-dependent force generation, which jointly propelled the nucleus. The limits of interstitial cell migration thus depend upon scaffold porosity and deformation of the nucleus, with pericellular collagenolysis and mechanocoupling as modulators.},
annote = {MMP-independent migration is limited by nucleus deformation and pore sizes below 7-10 uM{\^{}}2


Above certain pore sizes, proteolysis does not play a rate-limiting role and is dispensible.


There is a middle ground during which inhibition of collagenlysis slows migration due to the amelioration of pore widening, though cells can ultimately squeeze through or find alternative routes.},

Building on new mechanistic insights emerging from recent research, we offer our perspective on the metastatic process and reflect on possible paths of future exploration. We suggest that metastasis can be portrayed as a two-phase process: The first phase involves the physical translocation of a cancer cell to a distant organ, whereas the second encompasses the ability of the cancer cell to develop into a metastatic lesion at that distant site. Although much remains to be learned about the second phase, we feel that an understanding of the first phase is now within sight, due in part to a better understanding of how cancer cell behavior can be modified by a cell-biological program called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

Several key inducers of EMT are transcription factors that repress the expression of E-cadherin, whose loss is a hallmark of EMT. Epigenetic regulation encompasses three types of changes: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, each of which has been shown to play a key role in controlling epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. As we gain deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms controlling EMT processes and orchestrating all the metastatic steps, we broaden the therapeutic potentials of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA demethylating drugs and histone deacetylase/demethylase inhibitors, which can act upon metastasis-related genes, restoring their expression and biological functions.},

We investigate these alternate models of motility here and demonstrate that cancer cells have an absolute requirement for the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT1-MMP for invasion, and that protease-independent mechanisms of cell migration are only plausible when the collagen network is devoid of the covalent cross-links that characterize normal tissues.},

Unfortunately, resistance almost invariably develops. Recently, a phenomenon called "phenotype switching" has been identified as an escape route. By switching from a proliferative to an invasive state, melanoma cells can acquire resistance to these targeted therapeutics. Interestingly, phenotype switching bears a striking resemblance to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition that has been described to occur in cancer stem cells in other tumor types. We propose that these changes are manifestations of one and the same underlying feature, namely a dynamic and reversible phenotypic tumor cell plasticity that renders a proportion of cells both more invasive and resistant to therapy. At the same time, the specific characteristics of these tumor cell populations offer potential for being explored as target for therapeutic intervention.

Here we report a paradoxical effect of CCL2 in four syngeneic mouse models of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, interruption of CCL2 inhibition leads to an overshoot of metastases and accelerates death. This is the result of monocyte release from the bone marrow and enhancement of cancer cell mobilization from the primary tumour, as well as blood vessel formation and increased proliferation of metastatic cells in the lungs in an interleukin (IL)-6- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-dependent manner. Notably, inhibition of CCL2 and IL-6 markedly reduced metastases and increased survival of the animals. CCL2 has been implicated in various neoplasias and adopted as a therapeutic target. However, our results call for caution when considering anti-CCL2 agents as monotherapy in metastatic disease and highlight the tumour microenvironment as a critical determinant of successful anti-metastatic therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is highly aggressive and has higher risk of recurrence than HER2-negative cancer. With few treatment options available, new drug targets specific for HER2-positive breast cancer are needed.

METHODS: We conducted a pharmacological profiling of seven genotypically distinct breast cancer cell lines using a subset of inhibitors of breast cancer cells from a screen of the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. To identify molecular targets of nelfinavir, identified in the screen as a selective inhibitor of HER2-positive cells, we conducted a genome-wide screen of a haploinsufficiency yeast mutant collection. We evaluated antitumor activity of nelfinavir with xenografts in athymic nude mouse models (n = 4-6 per group) of human breast cancer and repeated mixed-effects regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.

RESULTS: Pharmacological profiling showed that nelfinavir, an anti-HIV drug, selectively inhibited the growth of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in vitro. A genome-wide screening of haploinsufficiency yeast mutants revealed that nelfinavir inhibited heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) function. Further characterization using proteolytic footprinting experiments indicated that nelfinavir inhibited HSP90 in breast cancer cells through a novel mechanism. In vivo, nelfinavir selectively inhibited the growth of HER2-positive breast cancer cells (tumor volume index of HCC1954 cells on day 29, vehicle vs nelfinavir, mean = 14.42 vs 5.16, difference = 9.25, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 5.93 to 12.56, P {\textless} .001; tumor volume index of BT474 cells on day 26, vehicle vs nelfinavir, mean = 2.21 vs 0.90, difference = 1.31, 95{\%} CI = 0.83 to 1.78, P {\textless} .001). Moreover, nelfinavir inhibited the growth of trastuzumab- and/or lapatinib-resistant, HER2-positive breast cancer cells in vitro at clinically achievable concentrations.

CONCLUSION: Nelfinavir was found to be a new class of HSP90 inhibitor and can be brought to HER2-breast cancer treatment trials with the same dosage regimen as that used among HIV patients.},

abstract = {The suppression of cancer metastasis is an urgent therapeutic need. Yet, most existing drugs inhibit only cancer cell proliferation. Historically, the reason is the much later elucidation of the molecular biology of metastasis versus that of the early steps in transformation. Because the molecules that drive the dissemination of malignant cells are shared among cancers, drugs that inhibit their functions will be broadly beneficial. There are two complementary anti-metastasis strategies, the prevention of cancer cell dissemination and the suppression of already existing metastases. To accelerate the availability of potentially life-saving anti-metastasis agents several adjustments must be made. The risk tolerance in drug trials needs to increase with a worsening prognosis. Clinical trials of drug molecules that prevent cancer dissemination need to be approved for use right after diagnosis, not after failure of standard-of-care therapies. For agents that treat existing metastases, the clinical trial system needs to be modernized. Because cancer metastasis is often fatal, improved and innovative approaches to anti-metastasis drugs are eminently suited to play a lead role in changing the standards of drug development.},

abstract = {Advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of diseases have expanded the number of plausible therapeutic targets for the development of innovative agents in recent decades. However, although investment in pharmaceutical research and development (R{\&}D) has increased substantially in this time, the lack of a corresponding increase in the output in terms of new drugs being approved indicates that therapeutic innovation has become more challenging. Here, using a large database that contains information on R{\&}D projects for more than 28,000 compounds investigated since 1990, we examine the decline of R{\&}D productivity in pharmaceuticals in the past two decades and its determinants. We show that this decline is associated with an increasing concentration of R{\&}D investments in areas in which the risk of failure is high, which correspond to unmet therapeutic needs and unexploited biological mechanisms. We also investigate the potential variations in productivity with regard to the regional location of companies and find that although companies based in the United States and Europe differ in the composition of their R{\&}D portfolios, there is no evidence of any productivity gap.},

abstract = {Cell migration is a multi-step process that leads to the actin-driven translocation of cells on or through tissue substrate. Basic steps involved in cell migration have been defined for two-dimensional haptokinetic migration which, however, does not provide physical constraints imposed by three-dimensional interstitial tissues. We here describe the process of pericellular proteolysis that leads to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and realignment during cell movement and integrate it into established steps of cell migration. After actin-driven leading edge protrusion (step I) and anterior formation of integrin-mediated focal interactions to the substrate (step II), ECM breakdown is focalized towards physical ECM barriers several micrometer rearward of the leading edge (step III). Actomyosin-mediated cell contraction (step IV) then leads to rear-end retraction and forward sliding of cell body and nucleus so that a small tube-like matrix defect bordered by realigned ECM fibers becomes apparent (step V). Pericellular proteolysis is thus integral to the migration cycle and serves to widen ECM gaps and thereby lowers physical stress upon the cell body, which ultimately leads to aligned higher-oder ECM patterns.},

abstract = {For cancer progression and metastatic dissemination, cancer cells migrate and penetrate through extracellular tissues. Cancer invasion is frequently facilitated by proteolytic processing of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The cellular regions mediating proteolysis are diverse and depend upon the physical structure, composition, and dimensionality of the ECM contacted by the cell surface. Cancer cells migrating across 2D substrate contain proteolytic structures such as lamellipodia, invadopodia, and the trailing edge. Likewise, invasive mesenchymal migration through 3D fibrillar ECM, as monitored for HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by submicron-resolved imaging, is mediated by several types of proteolytic structures rich in filamentous actin, ss1 integrin, and MT1-MMP with distinct location and function. These comprise (i) anterior pseudopod bifurcataions and the nucleus corresponding to zones of local cell compression by constraining collagen fibers, (ii) lateral small spikes that protrude into the ECM and cause small spot-like proteolytic foci, and (iii) a strongly proteolytic trailing edge sliding along reorganized ECM fibers. Through their combined action these proteolytic surface structures cleave, remove, and realign ECM barriers, support rear end retraction, generate tube-like matrix defects and laterally widen existing tracks during 3D tissue invasion.},

The application of genome-scale RNAi relies on the development of high quality HCS assays. The Z' factor statistic provides a way to evaluate whether or not screening run conditions (reagents, protocols, instrumentation, kinetics, and other conditions not directly related to the test compounds) are optimized. Z' factor, introduced by Zhang et al. (1), is a dimensionless value that represents both the variability and the dynamic range between two sets of sample control data. This paper describes a new extension of the Z' factor, which integrates multiple readouts for screening quality assessment. Currently presented multivariate Z' factor is based on linear projection, which may not be suitable for data with nonlinear structure. This paper proposes an algorithm which extends existing algorithm to deal with nonlinear data by using the kernel function. Using kernel methods for projections, multiple readouts are condensed to a single parameter, based on which the screening run quality is monitored.},

In this study, the authors show how machine learning-based classification of individual cells outperforms those classical ratio-based techniques. Using fluorescent intensity and morphological and texture features, they evaluated how the performance of data analysis increases with increasing feature numbers. Their findings are based on a case study involving an siRNA screen monitoring nucleoplasmic and nucleolar accumulation of a fluorescently tagged reporter protein. For the analysis, they developed a complete analysis workflow incorporating image segmentation, feature extraction, cell classification, hit detection, and visualization of the results. For the classification task, the authors have established a new graphical framework, the Advanced Cell Classifier, which provides a very accurate high-content screen analysis with minimal user interaction, offering access to a variety of advanced machine learning methods.},

abstract = {Methods that monitor the quality of a biological assay (i.e., its ability to discriminate between positive and negative controls) are essential for the development of robust assays. In screening, the most commonly used parameter for monitoring assay quality is the Z' factor, which is based on 1 selected readout. However, biological assays are able to monitor multiple readouts. For example, novel multiparametric screening technologies such as high-content screening provide information-rich data sets with multiple readouts on a compound's effect. Still, assay quality is commonly assessed by the Z' factor based on a single selected readout. This report suggests an extension of the Z' factor, which integrates multiple readouts for assay quality assessment. Using linear projections, multiple readouts are condensed to a single parameter, based on which the assay quality is monitored. The authors illustrate and evaluate this approach using simulated data and real-world data from a high-content screen. The suggested approach is applicable during assay development, to optimize the image analysis, as well as during screening to monitor assay robustness. Furthermore, data sets from high-content imaging assays and other state-of-the-art multiparametric screening technologies, such as flow cytometry or transcript analysis, could be analyzed.},

We discuss key aspects of performing this technique, such as methods that can be used to collect similarity estimates, analytic techniques for treating proximity data, and various concerns regarding interpretation of the MDS output.

abstract = {Genetic screens for phenotypic similarity have made key contributions to associating genes with biological processes. With RNA interference (RNAi), highly parallel phenotyping of loss-of-function effects in cells has become feasible. One of the current challenges however is the computational categorization of visual phenotypes and the prediction of biological function and processes. In this study, we describe a combined computational and experimental approach to discover novel gene functions and explore functional relationships. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in human cells and used quantitative descriptors derived from high-throughput imaging to generate multiparametric phenotypic profiles. We show that profiles predicted functions of genes by phenotypic similarity. Specifically, we examined several candidates including the largely uncharacterized gene DONSON, which shared phenotype similarity with known factors of DNA damage response (DDR) and genomic integrity. Experimental evidence supports that DONSON is a novel centrosomal protein required for DDR signalling and genomic integrity. Multiparametric phenotyping by automated imaging and computational annotation is a powerful method for functional discovery and mapping the landscape of phenotypic responses to cellular perturbations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the availability of many 'omics' data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics, the integrative or joint analysis of multiple datasets from different technology platforms is becoming crucial to unravel the relationships between different biological functional levels. However, the development of such an analysis is a major computational and technical challenge as most approaches suffer from high data dimensionality. New methodologies need to be developed and validated.

RESULTS: integrOmics efficiently performs integrative analyses of two types of 'omics' variables that are measured on the same samples. It includes a regularized version of canonical correlation analysis to enlighten correlations between two datasets, and a sparse version of partial least squares (PLS) regression that includes simultaneous variable selection in both datasets. The usefulness of both approaches has been demonstrated previously and successfully applied in various integrative studies.

AVAILABILITY: integrOmics is freely available from http://CRAN.R-project.org/ or from the web site companion (http://math.univ-toulouse.fr/biostat) that provides full documentation and tutorials.

Preclinical studies testing the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were so compelling that synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors (MPIs) were rapidly developed and routed into human clinical trials. The results of these trials have been disappointing. Here we review the studies that brought MPIs into clinical testing and discuss the design and outcome of the trials in light of new information about the cellular source, substrates, and mode of action of MMPs at different stages of tumor progression. The important lessons learned from the MPI experience may be of great value for future studies of MPIs and for cancer drug development in general.},

abstract = {Cancer research depends on the use of human cell lines for both the in vitro (culture) and in vivo (xenograft) analysis of tumor progression and treatment. However, the extent to which cultured preparations of human cancer lines display similar properties in vivo, where important host factors may influence tumor biology, remains unclear. Here, we address this question by conducting a functional proteomic analysis of the human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 grown in culture and as orthotopic xenograft tumors in the mammary fad pad of immunodeficient mice. Using a suite of activity-based chemical probes, we identified carcinoma (human) enzyme activities that were expressed selectively in culture or in xenograft tumors. Likewise, distinct groups of stromal (mouse) enzyme activities were found that either infiltrated or were excluded from xenograft tumors, indicating a contribution by specific host components to breast cancer development. MDA-MB-231 cells isolated from tumors exhibited profound differences in their enzyme activity profiles compared with the parent cell line, including the dramatic posttranscriptional up-regulation of the serine proteases urokinase plasminogen activator and tissue plasminogen activator and down-regulation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase. These altered enzyme activity profiles correlated with significantly greater tumor growth rates and metastases for xenograft-derived MDA-MB-231 cells upon reintroduction into mice. Collectively, these data indicate that the in vivo environment of the mouse mammary fat pad cultivates the growth of human breast cancer cells with elevated tumorigenic properties and highlight the value of activity-based protein profiling for identifying proteomic signatures that depict such changes in cancer cell biology.},

We can use mahalanobis distances extracted from principal component space rather than the original variable space. In this case the MD does not need to correct for the correlation in the data set - since by definition the variables obtained from PCA are uncorrelated to maximise variation. However, the way each of the residual principal components is weight in the computation of the distance must be taken into account.


Euclidean distance measured in normalised principal component space is, except for a constant factor, equal to the mahalanobis distance distance.

abstract = {To date, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the primary tool to identify genetic variants that cause phenotypic variation. As GWAS analyses are generally univariate in nature, multivariate phenotypic information is usually reduced to a single composite score. This practice often results in loss of statistical power to detect causal variants. Multivariate genotype-phenotype methods do exist but attain maximal power only in special circumstances. Here, we present a new multivariate method that we refer to as TATES (Trait-based Association Test that uses Extended Simes procedure), inspired by the GATES procedure proposed by Li et al (2011). For each component of a multivariate trait, TATES combines p-values obtained in standard univariate GWAS to acquire one trait-based p-value, while correcting for correlations between components. Extensive simulations, probing a wide variety of genotype-phenotype models, show that TATES's false positive rate is correct, and that TATES's statistical power to detect causal variants explaining 0.5{\%} of the variance can be 2.5-9 times higher than the power of univariate tests based on composite scores and 1.5-2 times higher than the power of the standard MANOVA. Unlike other multivariate methods, TATES detects both genetic variants that are common to multiple phenotypes and genetic variants that are specific to a single phenotype, i.e. TATES provides a more complete view of the genetic architecture of complex traits. As the actual causal genotype-phenotype model is usually unknown and probably phenotypically and genetically complex, TATES, available as an open source program, constitutes a powerful new multivariate strategy that allows researchers to identify novel causal variants, while the complexity of traits is no longer a limiting factor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complex traits may be defined by a range of different criteria. It would result in a loss of information to perform analyses simply on the basis of a final clinical dichotomized affected / unaffected variable.

RESULTS: We assess the performance of four alternative approaches for the analysis of multiple phenotypes in genetic association studies. We describe the four methods in detail and discuss their relative theoretical merits and disadvantages. Using simulation we demonstrate that PCA provides the greatest power when applied to both correlated phenotypes and with large numbers of phenotypes. The multivariate approach had low type I error only with independent phenotypes or small numbers of phenotypes. In this study, our application of the four methods to schizophrenia data provides converging evidence of the relative performance of the methods.

CONCLUSIONS: Via power analysis of simulated data and testing of experimental data, we conclude that PCA, creating one variable based on a linear combination of all the traits, performs optimally. We propose that our comparison will provide insight into the properties of the methods and help researchers to choose appropriate strategy in future experimental studies.},

abstract = {Rho family GTPases regulate the cytoskeleton and cell migration and are frequently overexpressed in tumours. Here, we identify two modes of tumour-cell motility in 3D matrices that involve different usage of Rho signalling. Rho signalling through ROCK promotes a rounded bleb-associated mode of motility that does not require pericellular proteolysis. This form of motility requires ezrin, which is localized in the direction of cell movement. In contrast, elongated cell motility is associated with Rac-dependent F-actin-rich protrusions and does not require Rho, ROCK or ezrin function. Combined blockade of extracellular proteases and ROCK negates the ability of tumour cells to switch between modes of motility and synergises to prevent tumour cell invasion.},

abstract = {Cell spreading, adhesion and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) involve bi-directional signalling and physical linkages between the ECM, integrins and the cell cytoskeleton. The actin-binding proteins talin1 and 2 link ligand-bound integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and increase the affinity of integrin for the ECM. Here we report that depletion of talin2 in talin1-null (talin1(-/-)) cells did not affect the initiation of matrix-activated spreading or Src family kinase (SFK) activation, but abolished the ECM-integrin-cytoskeleton linkage and sustained cell spreading and adhesion. Specifically, focal adhesion assembly, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling and traction force generation on substrates were severely affected. The talin1 head domain restored beta1 integrin activation but only full-length talin1 restored the ECM-cytoskeleton linkage and normal cytoskeleton organization. Our results demonstrate three biochemically distinct steps in fibronectin-activated cell spreading and adhesion: (1) fibronectin-integrin binding and initiation of spreading, (2) fast cell spreading and (3) focal adhesion formation and substrate traction. We suggest that talin is not required for initial cell spreading. However, talin provides the important mechanical linkage between ligand-bound integrins and the actin cytoskeleton required to catalyse focal adhesion-dependent pathways.},

abstract = {Tumor cells exhibit two different modes of individual cell movement. Mesenchymal-type movement is characterized by an elongated cellular morphology and requires extracellular proteolysis. In amoeboid movement, cells have a rounded morphology, are less dependent on proteases, and require high Rho-kinase signaling to drive elevated levels of actomyosin contractility. These two modes of cell movement are interconvertible. We show that mesenchymal-type movement in melanoma cells is driven by activation of the GTPase Rac through a complex containing NEDD9, a recently identified melanoma metastasis gene, and DOCK3, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rac signals through WAVE2 to direct mesenchymal movement and suppress amoeboid movement through decreasing actomyosin contractility. Conversely, in amoeboid movement, Rho-kinase signaling activates a Rac GAP, ARHGAP22, that suppresses mesenchymal movement by inactivating Rac. We demonstrate tight interplay between Rho and Rac in determining different modes of tumor cell movement, revealing how tumor cells switch between different modes of movement.},

abstract = {Invasive tumor dissemination in vitro and in vivo involves the proteolytic degradation of ECM barriers. This process, however, is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor-based treatment, suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of beta 1 integrins and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases, however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered beta 1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy. In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis.},

Mesenchymal migrations relies on high levels of attachment and cytoskeletal contractility which involves focal adhesions


The common underlying theme of migration is polarized acto-myosin driven shape change in the cell body.


2D migration requires unilateral adhesion to the substrate, providing a stable but transient attachment, and a flattened cell morphology guided by a leading lamellipodia.


3D migration through interstitial tissue consisting of a network of collagen fibres requires a spindle-shaped morphology with unilateral polarisation to the underlying substrate. Leading edge protrusion occurs by formation of pseudopodia that orient in 3 dimensions. The cell also accomodates into small tissue gaps or exucutes remodelling of the ECM structure by pericellular proteolysis.


Depending on the deformability of the migrating cell and the size of gaps and trails available in tissue, cells proteolytically remodel surrounding ECM and generate their own gaps, a hallmark of mesenchymal migration - otherwise they move without engaging proteases, by filling available spaces with their cell body.},

abstract = {Cell migration plays a central role in the invasion and metastasis of tumors. As cells leave the primary tumor, they undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate as single cells. Epithelial tumor cells may also migrate in a highly directional manner as a collective group in some settings. We previously discovered that myoferlin (MYOF) is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and depletion of MYOF results in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and reduced invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the biomechanical mechanisms governing cell motility during MYOF depletion are poorly understood. We first demonstrated that lentivirus-driven shRNA-induced MYOF loss in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA-231(MYOF-KD)) leads to an epithelial morphology compared to the mesenchymal morphology observed in control (MDA-231(LTVC)) and wild-type cells. Knockdown of MYOF led to significant reductions in cell migration velocity and MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells migrated directionally and collectively, while MDA-231(LTVC) cells exhibited single cell migration. Decreased migration velocity and collective migration were accompanied by significant changes in cell mechanics. MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells exhibited a 2-fold decrease in cell stiffness, a 2-fold increase in cell-substrate adhesion and a 1.5-fold decrease in traction force generation. In vivo studies demonstrated that when immunocompromised mice were implanted with MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells, tumors were smaller and demonstrated lower tumor burden. Moreover, MDA-231(MYOF-KD) tumors were highly circularized and did not invade locally into the adventia in contrast to MDA-231(LTVC)-injected animals. Thus MYOF loss is associated with a change in tumor formation in xenografts and leads to smaller, less invasive tumors. These data indicate that MYOF, a previously unrecognized protein in cancer, is involved in MDA-MB-231 cell migration and contributes to biomechanical alterations. Our results indicate that changes in biomechanical properties following loss of this protein may be an effective way to alter the invasive capacity of cancer cells.},
annote = {MYOF -{\textgreater} myoferlin 


knockdown of MYOF in MDA-MB-231 cells causes them to migrate in a collective fashion, though overall migration is roughly the same as control cells, they migrate at a slower velocity in a more direct path.


WT cells have greater velocity and a winding uncoordinated path.


Maybe once cells gathered in a collective, random variations in their migratory path are cancelled by one another, and this results in the more direct migratory path?

abstract = {Rho family GTPases regulate the cytoskeleton and cell migration and are frequently overexpressed in tumours. Here, we identify two modes of tumour-cell motility in 3D matrices that involve different usage of Rho signalling. Rho signalling through ROCK promotes a rounded bleb-associated mode of motility that does not require pericellular proteolysis. This form of motility requires ezrin, which is localized in the direction of cell movement. In contrast, elongated cell motility is associated with Rac-dependent F-actin-rich protrusions and does not require Rho, ROCK or ezrin function. Combined blockade of extracellular proteases and ROCK negates the ability of tumour cells to switch between modes of motility and synergises to prevent tumour cell invasion.},

abstract = {Cancer cells possess a broad spectrum of migration and invasion mechanisms. These include both individual and collective cell-migration strategies. Cancer therapeutics that are designed to target adhesion receptors or proteases have not proven to be effective in slowing tumour progression in clinical trials--this might be due to the fact that cancer cells can modify their migration mechanisms in response to different conditions. Learning more about the cellular and molecular basis of these different migration/invasion programmes will help us to understand how cancer cells disseminate and lead to new treatment strategies.},

The engagement of integrins and other adhesion receptors leads to recruitment of surface proteases towards attachment sites, which in turn degrade ECM components close to the cell surface.



Summary

* The process of tumour-cell invasion and metastasis is conventially understood as the migration of individual cells that detach from the prmary tumour, enter lymphatic vessesls or the blood stream and seed in distant organs.


* Novel imaging techniques together with re-evaluation of histopathological pattern formation in tumours, have provided a detailed view of cellular and molecuar migration dynamics in cancer cells.


* Cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumour either as individial cells, using amoeboid- or mesenchymal-type movement, or cell sheets, strants and clusters using collective migration.


* Cancer-cell migration is typically regulated by integrins, matrix-degrading enzymes, cell-cell adhesion molecules and cell-cell communication


* Cancer therapeutics designed to target adhesion receptors or proteases have not yet been shown to be effective in clincal trials. This might be due to the fact that the cancer cell's migration mechanisms can be reprogrammed, allowing it to maintain its invasive properties via morphological and functional de-differentiation


* These adaptive responses include the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the mesenchymal-amoieboid transition (MAT) and the collective-amoeboid transtion (CAT).


* Further studies are required to identify the factors that are involved in each type of cell migration, as well as related escape strategies that are used by cancer cells after pharmcotherapeutic intervention.



Five Step Migration Model

1) Protrusion of the leading edge
2) Cell-matrix interaction and formation of focal contacts
3) Recruitment of surface proteases to ECM contacts


4) Cell contraction by actomysosin
5) Detachment of the trailing edge.



1)
Protrusion of the leading edge: Growing actin filaments connect to adaptor proteins and push the cell membrane in an outwards direction. Actin polymerises by coupling to the actin-nucleating ARP2/3 complex, which binds to WASP, a multifunctional adaptor protein. The ARP2/3-WASP complex then connects to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via clustered PIPs insertin therein. ARP2/3 can duther interact laterally with pre-existing acin filaments and induce branching of pre-existing filament to actin networks. PIPs also bind and activate GEFs that regulate the activity of the small GTPases (RAC, CDC42, RHO and RAS). In one pathway, CDC42 binds to WASP and PIPs, which activates WASP and thereby induceds filopodial ruffling and pseudopod extension. Chemokines and growth-factor receptors activate PI3K and PI45K which are they key enzymez that generate PIPs and furtherengage RAC, CDC42 and RHO.



2) Cell matrix interaction and formation of focal contacts. Integrins come into contact with ECM ligands and cluster in the cell membrane. Clustered integrins recruit adaptor and signalling proteins via their intracellular domains, therby inducing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation signals into the cell ('outside in' signalling). The integrin cytoplasmic tail directly interacts with alpha-actinin, talin, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and other proteins such as tensin. All these proteins can bind adaptor proteins - through SH2, SH3 or proline-rich domains - to recruit actin-binding proteins as well as regulatory molceules (PI3K and RHO-GTPases) to focal contacts. A link between actin/ARP2/3 complex and emerging focal contacts is provided by vinculin. The assembly of focal contacts is directly and indirectly induced by various signalling pathways.



3) Recruitment of suface proteases to CRM contacts and focalized proteolysis. Surface protease become concentrated near substrate binding sites. In close proximity to the cell surface, proteases cleave ECM components, such as collagen, fibronectin and laminins, as well as pro-MMPs to create active soluble MMPs. 



4) Cell contraction by actomyosin. Active myosin II binds to actin filaments and generates actomyosin contraction. The Ca2+ and MLCK phosphorylates the myosin light chain (MLC) which activates myosin II. This is counteracted by dephosphorylation via MLCP. RHO regulates actomyosin contraction predominantly through its effector, ROCK, which phosphorylates and inhibits MCLP.



5) Detachment of the trailing edge. At the trailing edge, focal contact dissaembly occurs through several mechanisms. Actin binding and severing proteins cap actin filaments and cause actin filament strand breakage, respectively, therby promoting filament turnover. Phosphatases limit the assembly of cytoskeletal. The cytoplasmic protease calpain cleaves focal contact components. FAK causes focal contact disassembly by yet unknown mechanisms. Focal contacts are further weakened through proteolytic cleavage of adhesion receptors by sheddases and the accumulation of collagen fragments that are generated while the cell moves forward. Following focal contact disassembly, integrins detach from the substrate and become internalised via endocytotic vesicles for recycling towards the leading edge, or deposited onto the substrate.},

abstract = {Invasive tumor dissemination in vitro and in vivo involves the proteolytic degradation of ECM barriers. This process, however, is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor-based treatment, suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of beta 1 integrins and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases, however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered beta 1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy. In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis.},

This paradox is particularly relevant to the role of phenotypic assays in drug discovery. A recent analysis revealed that phenotypic drug discovery strategies were more successful for first-in-class medicines, whereas target-based molecular strategies were more successful for followers (Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011, 10, 507-519). The rationale for the success of phenotypic screening was the unbiased identification of the molecular mechanism of action. In this follow-up analysis, the format and mechanistic information used to establish the phenotypic assays that led to the first-in-class small-molecule new molecular entities approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008 were analyzed and compared with those approved in 2012. Not surprisingly, some level of mechanistic understanding was used to select the assay formats and chemicals screened. It is concluded that mechanism takes on different connotations depending on context and perspective and that a target need not always be the exclusive definition of mechanism.},

In addition, of 33 drugs identified in the absence of a target hypothesis, 25 were found through a chemocentric approach in which compounds with known pharmacology served as the starting point, with only eight coming from what we define here as phenotypic screening: testing a large number of compounds in a target-agnostic assay that monitors phenotypic changes. We also discuss the implications for drug discovery strategies, including viewing phenotypic screening as a novel discipline rather than as a neoclassical approach.},

Surprisingly, more first-in-class small-molecule drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1999 and 2008 were identified by functional phenotypic lead generation strategies reminiscent of pre-genomics pharmacology than contemporary molecular targeted strategies that encompass the vast majority of lead generation efforts. This observation, in conjunction with the difficulty in validating molecular targets for drug discovery, has diminished the impact of the "genomics revolution" and has led to a growing grassroots movement and now broader trend in pharma to reconsider the use of modern physiology-based or phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) strategies.

Terminology and the business case for use of PDD are defined. Key issues such as assay performance, chemical optimization, target identification, and challenges to the organization and implementation of PDD are discussed. Possible solutions for these challenges and a new neoclassic vision for PDD that combines phenotypic and functional approaches with technology innovations resulting from the genomics-driven era of target-based drug discovery (TDD) are also described.

Although the majority of these drugs originated from target-based discovery, we identified a significant number whose discovery depended on phenotypic screening approaches. We postulate that the contribution of phenotypic screening to cancer drug discovery has been hampered by a reliance on 'classical' nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity and mitotic arrest, exacerbated by a paucity of mechanistically defined cellular models for therapeutically translatable cancer phenotypes.

However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.},

abstract = {Cancer cells can invade three-dimensional matrices by distinct mechanisms, recently defined by their dependence on extracellular proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases. Upon treatment with protease inhibitors, some tumour cells undergo a 'mesenchymal to amoeboid' transition that allows invasion in the absence of pericellular proteolysis and matrix degradation. We show here that in HT1080 cells, this transition is associated with weakened integrin-dependent adhesion, consistently reduced cell surface expression of the alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptor and impaired signalling downstream, as judged by reduced autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). On examining cancer cells that use defined invasion strategies, we show that distinct from mesenchymal invasion, amoeboid invasion is independent of intracellular calpain 2 proteolytic activity that is usually needed for turnover of integrin-linked adhesions during two-dimensional planar migration. Moreover, an inhibitor of Rho/ROCK signalling, which specifically impairs amoeboid-like invasion, restores cell surface expression of alpha2beta1 integrin, downstream FAK autophosphorylation and calpain 2 sensitivity--features of mesenchymal invasion. These findings link weakened integrin function to a lack of requirement for calpain 2-mediated integrin adhesion turnover during amoeboid invasion. In keeping with the need for integrin adhesion turnover, mesenchymal invasion is uniquely sensitive to Src inhibitors. Thus, the need for a major pathway that controls integrin adhesion turnover defines and distinguishes cancer cell invasion strategies.},

abstract = {Recent advances in microscopic imaging technology, fluorescent reporter reagents, 3-dimensional (3D) cell models and multiparametric image analysis have enhanced our ability to model and understand complex cell physiology. Extension of these approaches to live cell, kinetic studies allows further spatial and temporal understanding of a multitude of dynamic functional events, including tumour cell invasion. Recent in vivo and 3D in vitro studies reveal how tumour cells utilize a diverse variety of mechanisms to permit invasion through 3D tissue environments. Such high degrees of diversity and plasticity between invasion mechanisms present a significant challenge to the successful treatment of malignant cancer. This review examines how advances in time-resolved imaging has contributed to the characterization of distinct modes of invasion and their associated molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we highlight the development of fluorescent reporter molecules and their incorporation into more predictive 3D in vitro and in vivo models, to enhance mechanistic analysis of tumour invasion. We also highlight the latest advances in kinetic imaging instrumentation applicable to in vitro and in vivo models of tumour invasion. We discuss how multiparametric image analysis can be used to interpret image data generated by these approaches. We further discuss how these approaches can be integrated into drug discovery pipelines to facilitate evaluation and selection of candidate drugs and novel pharmaceutical compositions, targeting multiple invasive mechanisms.},

abstract = {Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology introduced a miniaturized "antigen-down" or "dot-blot" immunoassay suitable for quantifying the relative, semi-quantitative or quantitative (if a well-accepted reference standard exists) abundance of total protein levels and post-translational modifications across a variety of biological samples including cultured cells, tissues, and body fluids. The recent evolution of RPPA combined with more sophisticated sample handling, optical detection, quality control, and better quality affinity reagents provides exquisite sensitivity and high sample throughput at a reasonable cost per sample. This facilitates large-scale multiplex analysis of multiple post-translational markers across samples from in vitro, preclinical, or clinical samples. The technical power of RPPA is stimulating the application and widespread adoption of RPPA methods within academic, clinical, and industrial research laboratories. Advances in RPPA technology now offer scientists the opportunity to quantify protein analytes with high precision, sensitivity, throughput, and robustness. As a result, adopters of RPPA technology have recognized critical success factors for useful and maximum exploitation of RPPA technologies, including the following: preservation and optimization of pre-analytical sample quality, application of validated high-affinity and specific antibody (or other protein affinity) detection reagents, dedicated informatics solutions to ensure accurate and robust quantification of protein analytes, and quality-assured procedures and data analysis workflows compatible with application within regulated clinical environments. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the first three Global RPPA workshops were held in the United States, Europe, and Japan, respectively. These workshops provided an opportunity for RPPA laboratories, vendors, and users to share and discuss results, the latest technology platforms, best practices, and future challenges and opportunities. The outcomes of the workshops included a number of key opportunities to advance the RPPA field and provide added benefit to existing and future participants in the RPPA research community. The purpose of this report is to share and disseminate, as a community, current knowledge and future directions of the RPPA technology.},

Single-molecule multiparameter fluorescence detection also provides first information on the structure of a complex not observed by x-ray crystallography. This species did not incorporate nucleotides and is structurally distinct from the other two observed species. We determined that the nucleic acid substrate is bound at a site far removed from the nucleic acid-binding tract observed by crystallography. In contrast, the other two states are identified as being similar to the x-ray crystal structure and represent distinct enzymatically productive stages in DNA polymerization. These species differ by only a 5-A shift in the position of the nucleic acid. Addition of nucleoside triphosphate or of inorganic pyrophosphate allowed us to assign them as the educt and product state in the polymerization reaction cycle; i.e., the educt state is a complex in which the nucleic acid is positioned to allow nucleotide incorporation. The second RT:nucleic acid complex is the product state, which is formed immediately after nucleotide incorporation, but before RT translates to the next nucleotide.},

abstract = {Recent advances in automated high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and robotic handling have made the systematic and cost effective study of diverse morphological changes within a large population of cells possible under a variety of perturbations, e.g., drugs, compounds, metal catalysts, RNA interference (RNAi). Cell population-based studies deviate from conventional microscopy studies on a few cells, and could provide stronger statistical power for drawing experimental observations and conclusions. However, it is challenging to manually extract and quantify phenotypic changes from the large amounts of complex image data generated. Thus, bioimage informatics approaches are needed to rapidly and objectively quantify and analyze the image data. This paper provides an overview of the bioimage informatics challenges and approaches in image-based studies for drug and target discovery. The concepts and capabilities of image-based screening are first illustrated by a few practical examples investigating different kinds of phenotypic changes caEditorsused by drugs, compounds, or RNAi. The bioimage analysis approaches, including object detection, segmentation, and tracking, are then described. Subsequently, the quantitative features, phenotype identification, and multidimensional profile analysis for profiling the effects of drugs and targets are summarized. Moreover, a number of publicly available software packages for bioimage informatics are listed for further reference. It is expected that this review will help readers, including those without bioimage informatics expertise, understand the capabilities, approaches, and tools of bioimage informatics and apply them to advance their own studies.},

The advanced genetic toolkit of Drosophila makes it possible to label molecular and cellular components with unprecedented level of specificity necessitating the application of the most sophisticated imaging technologies. Imaging in Drosophila spans all scales from single molecules to the entire populations of adult organisms, from electron microscopy to live imaging of developmental processes. As the imaging approaches become more complex and ambitious, there is an increasing need for quantitative, computer-mediated image processing and analysis to make sense of the imagery. Bioimage Informatics is an emerging research field that covers all aspects of biological image analysis from data handling, through processing, to quantitative measurements, analysis and data presentation. Some of the most advanced, large scale projects, combining cutting edge imaging with complex bioimage informatics pipelines, are realized in the Drosophila research community. In this review, we discuss the current research in biological image analysis specifically relevant to the type of systems level image datasets that are uniquely available for the Drosophila model system. We focus on how state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms are impacting the ability of Drosophila researchers to analyze biological systems in space and time. We pay particular attention to how these algorithmic advances from computer science are made usable to practicing biologists through open source platforms and how biologists can themselves participate in their further development.},

abstract = {Advances in diagnosis and treatment have rendered most solid tumors largely curable if they are diagnosed and treated before dissemination. However, once they spread beyond the initial primary location, these cancers are usually highly morbid, if not fatal. Thus, current efforts focus on both limiting initial dissemination and preventing secondary spread. There are two modes of tumor dissemination - invasion and metastasis - each leading to unique therapeutic challenges and likely to be driven by distinct mechanisms. However, these two forms of dissemination utilize some common strategies to accomplish movement from the primary tumor, establishment in an ectopic site, and survival therein. The adaptive behaviors of motile cancer cells provide an opening for therapeutic approaches if we understand the molecular, cellular, and tissue biology that underlie them. Herein, we review the signaling cascades and organ reactions that lead to dissemination, as these are non-genetic in nature, focusing on cell migration as the key to tumor progression. In this context, the cellular phenotype will also be discussed because the modes of migration are dictated by quantitative and physical aspects of the cell motility machinery.},

Although heterogeneity has become an accepted characteristic of a population of cells, in drug discovery it is not routinely evaluated or reported. The standard practice for cell-based, high content assays has been to assume a normal distribution and to report a well-to-well average value with a standard deviation. To address this important issue we sought to define a method that could be readily implemented to identify, quantify and characterize heterogeneity in cellular and small organism assays to guide decisions during drug discovery and experimental cell/tissue profiling. Our study revealed that heterogeneity can be effectively identified and quantified with three indices that indicate diversity, non-normality and percent outliers. The indices were evaluated using the induction and inhibition of STAT3 activation in five cell lines where the systems response including sample preparation and instrument performance were well characterized and controlled. These heterogeneity indices provide a standardized method that can easily be integrated into small and large scale screening or profiling projects to guide interpretation of the biology, as well as the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. Understanding the heterogeneity in the response to perturbagens will become a critical factor in designing strategies for the development of therapeutics including targeted polypharmacology.},

abstract = {Autophagy plays an important role in cancer and it has been suggested that it functions not only as a tumor suppressor pathway to prevent tumor initiation, but also as a pro-survival pathway that helps tumor cells endure metabolic stress and resist death triggered by chemotherapeutic agents, including acquired resistance. We aimed to identify small-molecule autophagy inhibitors using a HTS/HCA approach through a phenotypic, cell image-based assay, in order to screen multiple biological targets simultaneously and to screen compounds in a physiologically relevant environment. LC3 is a component of the autophagosome, which undergoes a cytoplasmic redistribution from diffuse to punctate dots during autophagy. We employed HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3 in a primary phenotypic screen. As a first step, a "Validation Library" of about 8,000 pre-selected compounds, about 25{\%} of which had known biological activity and the others representing a range of chemical structures, was run in duplicate both to assess screening suitability and likely hit rate, and to give a valuable preview of possible active structures or biological targets. The primary screen of about 0.25 million compounds yielded around 10,500 positive compounds. These were tested in a suite of further cellular assays designed to eliminate unwanted positives, together with the application of chemi- and bioinformatics to pick out compounds with known biological activity. These processes enabled the selection of compounds that were the most promisingly active and specific. The screening "tree" identified, amongst others with as yet unidentified targets, chemical series active against autophagy-relevant biological targets ULK or Vsp34, validating the phenotypic screening methods selected. Finally, about 400 compounds were fully qualified after following this triage. The development of the assays, compound screening process and the compound triage is described.},

They are formed by an ordered organization of $\alpha$-tubulin and $\beta$-tubulin hetero-polymers. Altering microtubule polymerization has been known to be the mechanism of action for a number of therapeutically important drugs including taxanes and epothilones. Traditional cell-based assays for tubulin-interacting compounds rely on their indirect effects on cell cycle and/or cell proliferation. Direct monitoring of compound effects on microtubules is required to dissect detailed mechanisms of action in a cellular setting. Here we report a high-content assay platform to monitor tubulin polymerization status by directly measuring the acute effects of drug candidates on the cellular tubulin network with the capability to dissect the mechanisms of action. This high-content analysis distinguishes in a quantitative manner between compounds that act as tubulin stabilizers versus those that are tubulin destabilizers. In addition, using a multiplex approach, we expanded this analysis to simultaneously monitor physiological cellular responses and associated cellular phenotypes.},

abstract = {Phenotypic screening offers a powerful approach to identify small molecules that perturb complex biological processes in cells and organisms. The tendency of small molecules, however, to interact with multiple protein targets, often with moderate to weak affinities, along with the lack of straightforward technologies to characterize these interactions in living systems, has hindered efforts to understand the mechanistic basis for pharmacological activity. Here we address this challenge by creating a fully functionalized small-molecule library whose membership is endowed with: (1) one or more diversity elements to promote interactions with different protein targets in cells, (2) a photoreactive group for UV light-induced covalent cross-linking to interacting proteins, and (3) an alkyne handle for reporter tag conjugation to visualize and identify cross-linked proteins. A library member was found to inhibit cancer cell proliferation selectively under nutrient-limiting (low glucose) conditions. Quantitative chemoproteomics identified MT-ND1, an integral membrane subunit of the ∼1 MDa NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex 1) involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as a specific target of the active probe. We further demonstrated that the active probe inhibits complex 1 activity in vitro (IC(50) = 720 nM), an effect that is known to induce cell death in low-glucose conditions. Based on this proof of principle study, we anticipate that the generation and integration of fully functionalized compound libraries into phenotypic screening programs should facilitate the discovery of bioactive probes that are amenable to accelerated target identification and mechanistic characterization using advanced chemoproteomic technologies.},

Here we describe the application of an RNAi-based forward genomics approach toward understanding the biology and mechanism of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TRAIL is a TNF superfamily member that induces selective cytotoxicity of tumor cells when bound to its cognate receptors. In addition to detecting well-characterized genes in the apoptosis pathway, we uncover several modulators including DOBI, a gene required for progression of the apoptotic signal through the intrinsic mitochondrial cell death pathway, and MIRSA, a gene that acts to limit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest a role for MYC and the WNT pathway in maintaining susceptibility to TRAIL. Collectively, these observations offer several insights on how TRAIL mediates the selective killing of tumor cells and demonstrate the utility of large-scale RNAi screens in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Phenotypic screening seeks to identify substances that modulate phenotypes in a desired manner with the aim of progressing first-in-class agents. Successful campaigns require physiological relevance, robust screening, and an ability to deconvolute perturbed pathways. High-content analysis (HCA) is increasingly used in cell biology and offers one approach to prosecution of phenotypic screens, but challenges exist in exploitation where data generated are high volume and complex. We combine development of an organotypic model with novel HCA tools to map phenotypic responses to pharmacological perturbations. We describe implementation for angiogenesis, a process that has long been a focus for therapeutic intervention but has lacked robust models that recapitulate more completely mechanisms involved. The study used human primary endothelial cells in co-culture with stromal fibroblasts to model multiple aspects of angiogenic signaling: cell interactions, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Multiple quantitative descriptors were derived from automated microscopy using custom-designed algorithms. Data were extracted using a bespoke informatics platform that integrates processing, statistics, and feature display into a streamlined workflow for building and interrogating fingerprints. Ninety compounds were characterized, defining mode of action by phenotype. Our approach for assessing phenotypic outcomes in complex assay models is robust and capable of supporting a range of phenotypic screens at scale.},

abstract = {Quantitative microscopy has proven a versatile and powerful phenotypic screening technique. Recently, image-based profiling has shown promise as a means for broadly characterizing molecules' effects on cells in several drug-discovery applications, including target-agnostic screening and predicting a compound's mechanism of action (MOA). Several profiling methods have been proposed, but little is known about their comparative performance, impeding the wider adoption and further development of image-based profiling. We compared these methods by applying them to a widely applicable assay of cultured cells and measuring the ability of each method to predict the MOA of a compendium of drugs. A very simple method that is based on population means performed as well as methods designed to take advantage of the measurements of individual cells. This is surprising because many treatments induced a heterogeneous phenotypic response across the cell population in each sample. Another simple method, which performs factor analysis on the cellular measurements before averaging them, provided substantial improvement and was able to predict MOA correctly for 94{\%} of the treatments in our ground-truth set. To facilitate the ready application and future development of image-based phenotypic profiling methods, we provide our complete ground-truth and test data sets, as well as open-source implementations of the various methods in a common software framework.},

abstract = {GNRH significantly inhibits proliferation of a proportion of cancer cell lines by activating GNRH receptor (GNRHR)-G protein signaling. Therefore, manipulation of GNRHR signaling may have an under-utilized role in treating certain breast and ovarian cancers. However, the precise signaling pathways necessary for the effect and the features of cellular responses remain poorly defined. We used transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to characterize the effects of GNRHR activation in sensitive cells (HEK293-GNRHR, SCL60) in vitro and in vivo, compared to unresponsive HEK293. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated a dynamic response to the GNRH superagonist Triptorelin. Early and mid-phase changes (0.5-1.0 h) comprised mainly transcription factors. Later changes (8-24 h) included a GNRH target gene, CGA, and up- or downregulation of transcripts encoding signaling and cell division machinery. Pathway analysis identified altered MAPK and cell cycle pathways, consistent with occurrence of G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway gene transcripts were differentially expressed between control and Triptorelin-treated SCL60 cultures. Reverse-phase protein and phospho-proteomic array analyses profiled responses in cultured cells and SCL60 xenografts in vivo during Triptorelin anti-proliferation. Increased phosphorylated NF-$\kappa$B (p65) occurred in SCL60 in vitro, and p-NF-$\kappa$B and I$\kappa$B$\epsilon$ were higher in treated xenografts than controls after 4 days Triptorelin. NF-$\kappa$B inhibition enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of Triptorelin in SCL60 cultures. This study reveals details of pathways interacting with intense GNRHR signaling, identifies potential anti-proliferative target genes, and implicates the NF-$\kappa$B survival pathway as a node for enhancing GNRH agonist-induced anti-proliferation.},

abstract = {Kinase inhibitors have limited success in cancer treatment because tumors circumvent their action. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, and prevention of proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 inhibition, but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer.},

abstract = {Tumor cells metastasize to distant organs through genetic and epigenetic alterations, including changes in microRNA (miR) expression. Here we find miR-22 triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhances invasiveness and promotes metastasis in mouse xenografts. In a conditional mammary gland-specific transgenic (TG) mouse model, we show that miR-22 enhances mammary gland side-branching, expands the stem cell compartment, and promotes tumor development. Critically, miR-22 promotes aggressive metastatic disease in MMTV-miR-22 TG mice, as well as compound MMTV-neu or -PyVT-miR-22 TG mice. We demonstrate that miR-22 exerts its metastatic potential by silencing antimetastatic miR-200 through direct targeting of the TET (Ten eleven translocation) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, thereby inhibiting demethylation of the mir-200 promoter. Finally, we show that miR-22 overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and silencing of the TET-miR-200 axis in patients. Taken together, our findings implicate miR-22 as a crucial epigenetic modifier and promoter of EMT and breast cancer stemness toward metastasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Yes-associated protein (YAP1) is frequently reported to function as an oncogene in many types of cancer, but in breast cancer results remain controversial. We set out to clarify the role of YAP1 in breast cancer by examining gene and protein expression in subgroups of patient material and by downregulating YAP1 in vitro and studying its role in response to the widely used anti-estrogen tamoxifen.

METHODS: YAP1 protein intensity was scored as absent, weak, intermediate or strong in two primary breast cancer cohorts (n = 144 and n = 564) and mRNA expression of YAP1 was evaluated in a gene expression dataset (n = 1107). Recurrence-free survival was analysed using the log-rank test and Cox multivariate analysis was used to test for independence. WST-1 assay was employed to measure cell viability and a luciferase ERE (estrogen responsive element) construct was used to study the effect of tamoxifen, following downregulation of YAP1 using siRNAs.

RESULTS: In the ER+ (Estrogen Receptor $\alpha$ positive) subgroup of the randomised cohort, YAP1 expression was inversely correlated to histological grade and proliferation (p = 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively) whereas in the ER- (Estrogen Receptor $\alpha$ negative) subgroup YAP1 expression correlated positively to proliferation (p = 0.005). Notably, low YAP1 mRNA was independently associated with decreased recurrence-free survival in the gene expression dataset, specifically for the luminal A subgroup (p {\textless} 0.001) which includes low proliferating tumours of lower grade, usually associated with a good prognosis. This subgroup specificity led us to hypothesize that YAP1 may be important for response to endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, extensively used for luminal A breast cancers. In a tamoxifen randomised patient material, absent YAP1 protein expression was associated with impaired tamoxifen response which was significant upon interaction analysis (p = 0.042). YAP1 downregulation resulted in increased progesterone receptor (PgR) expression and a delayed and weaker tamoxifen in support of the clinical data.

CONCLUSIONS: Decreased YAP1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in the less aggressive luminal A breast cancer subgroup, likely due to the decreased tamoxifen sensitivity conferred by YAP1 downregulation.},

abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) pathway is commonly activated in breast cancer and aberrations such as PI3K mutations are common. Recent exciting clinical trial results in advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER) breast cancer support mTOR activation is a major means of estrogen-independent tumor growth. Hence the means to identify a responsive breast cancer population that would most benefit from these compounds in the adjuvant or earlier stage setting is of high interest. Here we study PIK3CA genotype as well as a previously reported PI3K/mTOR-pathway gene signature (PIK3CA-GS) and their ability to estimate the level of PI3K pathway activation in two clinical trials of newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer patients- a total of 81 patients- one of which was randomized between letrozole and placebo vs letrozole and everolimus. The main objectives were to correlate the baseline PIK3CA genotype and GS with the relative change from baseline to day 15 in Ki67 (which has been shown to be prognostic in breast cancer) and phosphorylated S6 (S240) immunohistochemistry (a substrate of mTOR). In the randomized dataset, the PIK3CA-GS could identify those patients with the largest relative decreases in Ki67 to letrozole/everolimus (R = -0.43, p = 0.008) compared with letrozole/placebo (R = 0.07, p = 0.58; interaction test p = 0.02). In a second dataset of pre-surgical everolimus alone, the PIK3CA-GS was not significantly correlated with relative change in Ki67 (R = -0.11, p = 0.37) but with relative change in phosphorlyated S6 (S240) (R = -0.46, p = 0.028). PIK3CA genotype was not significantly associated with any endpoint in either datasets. Our results suggest that the PIK3CA-GS has potential to identify those ER-positive BCs who may benefit from the addition of everolimus to letrozole. Further evaluation of the PIK3CA-GS as a predictive biomarker is warranted as it may facilitate better selection of responsive patient populations for mTOR inhibition in combination with letrozole.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Wnt signalling has been implicated in stem cell regulation however its role in breast cancer stem cell regulation remains unclear.

METHODS: We used a panel of normal and breast cancer cell lines to assess Wnt pathway gene and protein expression, and for the investigation of Wnt signalling within stem cell-enriched populations, mRNA and protein expression was analysed after the selection of anoikis-resistant cells. Finally, cell lines and patient-derived samples were used to investigate Wnt pathway effects on stem cell activity in vitro.

RESULTS: Wnt pathway signalling increased in cancer compared to normal breast and in both cell lines and patient samples, expression of Wnt pathway genes correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Furthermore, specific Wnt pathway genes were predictive for recurrence within subtypes of breast cancer. Canonical Wnt pathway genes were increased in breast cancer stem cell-enriched populations in comparison to normal breast stem cell-enriched populations. Furthermore in cell lines, the ligand Wnt3a increased whilst the inhibitor DKK1 reduced mammosphere formation with the greatest inhibitory effects observed in ER+ve breast cancer cell lines. In patient-derived metastatic breast cancer samples, only ER-ve mammospheres were responsive to the ligand Wnt3a. However, the inhibitor DKK1 efficiently inhibited both ER+ve and ER-ve breast cancer but not normal mammosphere formation, suggesting that the Wnt pathway is aberrantly activated in breast cancer mammospheres.

CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data highlight differential Wnt signalling in breast cancer subtypes and activity in patient-derived metastatic cancer stem-like cells indicating a potential for Wnt-targeted treatment in breast cancers.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Aberrant CpG island promoter DNA hypermethylation is frequently observed in cancer and is believed to contribute to tumor progression by silencing the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Previously, we observed that promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer reflects cell lineage rather than tumor progression and occurs at genes that are already repressed in a lineage-specific manner. To investigate the generality of our observation we analyzed the methylation profiles of 1,154 cancers from 7 different tissue types. RESULTS: We find that 1,009 genes are prone to hypermethylation in these 7 types of cancer. Nearly half of these genes varied in their susceptibility to hypermethylation between different cancer types. We show that the expression status of hypermethylation prone genes in the originator tissue determines their propensity to become hypermethylated in cancer; specifically, genes that are normally repressed in a tissue are prone to hypermethylation in cancers derived from that tissue. We also show that the promoter regions of hypermethylation-prone genes are depleted of repetitive elements and that DNA sequence around the same promoters is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that these two characteristics reflect tissue-specific gene promoter architecture regulating the expression of these hypermethylation prone genes in normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: As aberrantly hypermethylated genes are already repressed in pre-cancerous tissue, we suggest that their hypermethylation does not directly contribute to cancer development via silencing. Instead aberrant hypermethylation reflects developmental history and the perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms maintaining these repressed promoters in a hypomethylated state in normal cells.},

abstract = {Proteomic profiling of the estrogen/tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cell line and its partially sensitive (MCF-7/LCC1) and fully resistant (MCF-7/LCC9) variants was performed to identify modifiers of endocrine sensitivity in breast cancer. Analysis of the expression of 120 paired phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated epitopes in key oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways revealed that STAT1 and several phosphorylated epitopes (phospho-STAT1(Tyr701) and phospho-STAT3(Ser727)) were differentially expressed between endocrine resistant and parental controls, confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The STAT1 inhibitor EGCG was a more effective inhibitor of the endocrine resistant MCF-7/LCC1 and MCF-7/LCC9 lines than parental MCF-7 cells, while STAT3 inhibitors Stattic and WP1066 were equally effective in endocrine-resistant and parental lines. The effects of the STAT inhibitors were additive, rather than synergistic, when tested in combination with tamoxifen in vitro. Expression of STAT1 and STAT3 were measured by quantitative immunofluorescence in invasive breast cancers and matched lymph nodes. When lymph node expression was compared to its paired primary breast cancer expression, there was greater expression of cytoplasmic STAT1 (∼3.1 fold), phospho-STAT3(Ser727) (∼1.8 fold), and STAT5 (∼1.5 fold) and nuclear phospho-STAT3(Ser727) (∼1.5 fold) in the nodes. Expression levels of STAT1 and STAT3 transcript were analysed in 550 breast cancers from publicly available gene expression datasets (GSE2990, GSE12093, GSE6532). When treatment with tamoxifen was considered, STAT1 gene expression was nearly predictive of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, log-rank p = 0.067), while STAT3 gene expression was predictive of DMFS (log-rank p{\textless}0.0001). Analysis of STAT1 and STAT3 protein expression in a series of 546 breast cancers also indicated that high expression of STAT3 protein was associated with improved survival (DMFS, p = 0.006). These results suggest that STAT signaling is important in endocrine resistance, and that STAT inhibitors may represent potential therapies in breast cancer, even in the resistant setting.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},
